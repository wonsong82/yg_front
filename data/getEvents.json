Despite rush of new songs pouring onto charts, \u201cWHISTLE\u201d stayed in No.1 for 16 days in a row and also swept No.1 on six monthly charts, exerting unprecedentedly large influence. Notably, \u201cWHISTLE\u201d topped the digital, download, streaming, and mobile chart of Gaon Chart of August of 2016.\r\nBLACKPINK\u2019s popularity went beyond Korea. It took No.1 on iTunes chart of 14 countries; seventh place on British Amazon\u2019s \u201cRap &amp; Hip-Hop Hot New Release\u201d chart; and No.1 on the weekly, popularity, music video, and K-pop music video chart of China\u2019s biggest music-streaming website QQ Music. With such big success which is unbelievably exceptional for a rookie artist, BLACKPINK wrote new history in the music scene.\r\n\u25b6 The icon of the \u201cfirst and shortest\u201d!\r\nBLACKPINK recorded so many \u201cfirsts\u201d and \u201cshortests\u201d after their debut. BLACKPINK took their first No.1 in a TV music show within 14 days from their debut in SBS \u201cINKIGAYO\u201d, which was the shortest period of time ever recorded by a girl group. Plus, BLACKPINK took No.1 and No.2 on American Billboard\u2019s World Digital Songs chart with \u201cBOOMBAYAH\u201d and \u201cWHISTLE\u201d within the shortest-ever period of time for a Korean girl group, to prove their big influence once again.\r\nThe official music videos of \u201cBOOMBAYAH\u201d and \u201cWHISTLE\u201d released on YouTube along with the songs are recording 34,660,099 views and 28,481,564 views, respectively, surpassing 60 million views in total.\r\nMusic fans are paying keen attention to BLACKPINK\u2019s future to be unfolded after their successful debut.","post_date":"2016-09-12","main_image":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/2016091301000955600065691_99_20160912100804.jpg","thumb_1x1":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/2016091301000955600065691_99_20160912100804.jpg","thumb_3x2":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/2016091301000955600065691_99_20160912100804.jpg","excerpt":"BLACKPINK wraps up performances for their debut single\u2026 \u201cWill come back quickly\u201d","url_friendly_name":"blackpink-wraps-up-performances-for-their-debut-single-will-come-back-quickly","artist_id":602,"related_event":[1590,1592,1369]},"1703":{"id":1703,"post_title":"iKON\u2019s second Japan arena tour has begun!

BLACKPINK has been no.1 in everything ever since their debut. Not only did the group sweep the realtime online charts upon debut but also became no.1 on music shows and brand power, and it\u2019s only been one month since they debuted.\r\n\r\nOn September 8, BLACKPINK\u2019s \u201cWHISTLE\u201d became no.1 on Mnet\u2019s M Countdown. This is especially meaningful since they never appeared on the show.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s BLACKPINK\u2019s second no.1 trophy following the one they won on SBS\u2019s Inkigayo on August 21. BLACKPINK will be rounding off their promotions for their debut album \u201cSQAUARE ONE\u201d with their appearance on Inkigayo this week. If BLACKPINK become no.1 on Inkigayo again this week, the group will be winning Inkigayo trophies for two weeks in a row. BLACKPINK is highly likely to win this week too as their online charts results are good.\r\n\r\nThe fact that BLACKPINK became no.1 on music shows with their debut song proves that the group has staying power. Already, the group has taken the online charts by storm with the title tracks of their debut album, \u201cWHISTLE\u201d and \u201cBOOMBAYAH\u201d. In particular, \u201cWHISTLE\u201d maintained the no.1 spot for almost a month, which is rare for a rookie\u2019s song. BLACKPINK became no.1 on a music show in the shortest time among girl groups.\r\n\r\nBLACKPINK has also dominated the monthly charts. \u201cWHISTLE\u201d remains high on the charts of Melon, the biggest music streaming website in Korea. BLACKPINK also topped four Gaon charts in August including its digital chart, streaming chart, and download chart.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Korea Company Reputation Research Institute, BLACKPINK has the best brand reputation among girl groups. The Institute analyzed 40,887,502 bytes of data from August 9 to September 10 to find out which girl group has the biggest brand power. BLACKPINK scored the highest in participation index, media index, communication index, and reputation index, becoming the queen of girl groups.\r\n\r\nBLACKPINK was followed by other girl group in the order of I.O.I, Twice, GFriend, Red Velvet, Oh My Girl, Laboum, Girls\u2019 Generation, Apink, Mamamoo, Tiara, AOA, Lovelyz, Girl\u2019s Day, Sistar, Gugudan, Nine Muses, Wonder Girls, EXID, and April.\r\n\r\nBLACKPINK\u2019s participation index stood at 4,038,400, media index at 225,126, communication index at 3,000,393, and brand reputation index at 7,468,3741. BLACKPINK\u2019s brand reputation index was almost double of that of I.O.I, who came second with 4,127,257.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s not an exaggeration to say that there has never been a hotter girl group than BLACKPINK. This is why we are looking forward to seeing them more.","post_date":"2016-09-11","main_image":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/2016091301000955600065691_99_20160912100804.jpg","thumb_1x1":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/2016091301000955600065691_99_20160912100804.jpg","thumb_3x2":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/2016091301000955600065691_99_20160912100804.jpg","excerpt":"[Music Talk Talk] BLACKPINK Tops Everything, From Monthly Charts to Brand Power","url_friendly_name":"music-talk-talk-blackpink-tops-everything-from-monthly-charts-to-brand-power","artist_id":602,"related_event":[1626,1590]},"1736":{"id":1736,"post_title":"CL to Appear on CBS\u2019s The Late Late Show","post_content":"[\ub3d9\uc544\ub2f7\ucef4=\uc7a5\uacbd\uad6d \uae30\uc790]\u00a0CL will appear on CBS\u2019s main talk show all set to capture the hearts of US viewers.\r\n\r\nAt 12:35 on September 16 (EST), CL will appear on CBS\u2019s The Late Late Show with James Corden.

Music] BLACKPINK\u2019s never-ending popularity\u2026 No.1 in TV music show again","post_content":"[OSEN=\uc120\ubbf8\uacbd \uae30\uc790]\u00a0BLACKPINK\u2019s popularity never ends. BLACKPINK is creating sensation continuously, in the second week of September, the time when they are giving the last performance for their debut single. In cable channel Mnet\u2019s \u201cM-Countdown\u201d that was live-broadcasted on September 8 in the evening, BLACKPINK took their first No.1 in the show with debut song \u201cWHISTLE\u201d. Such achievement is all the more meaningful, as they took No.1 without appearance in the show.\r\nThe No.1 in \u201cM-Countdown\u201d is the second No.1 in a TV music show for BLACKPINK, following the first No.1 in SBS \u201cINKIGAYO\u201d on the 21 last month. BLACKPINK will wrap up performances for their debut single \u201cSQUARE ONE\u201d, with a performance in this week\u2019s \u201cINKIGAYO\u201d (exclusively reported by OSEN). If BLACKPINK takes No.1 in this week\u2019s \u201cINKIGAYO\u201d that will not be aired because the day is Thanksgiving holiday, BLACKPINK will practically take No.1 in the show for two weeks in a row. Considering records on charts, BLACKPINK is highly likely to take No.1 in this week\u2019s \u201cINKIGAYO\u201d.\r\nBLACKPINK released debut single \u201cSQUARE ONE\u201d on the 8 last month, to hit music charts by the storm with double title tracks \u201cWHISTLE\u201d and \u201cBOOMBAYAH\u201d. Notably, \u201cWHISTLE\u201d stayed in No.1 on charts for about a month, recording a long-run hit so exceptionally for a rookie. The team also took No.1 in a public TV\u2019s music show within the shortest-ever period of time since debut for a rookie girl group. Because of such big popularity they enjoyed upon their debut, BLACKPINK has given performances for a longer period than originally scheduled.\r\nAn YG insider said, \u201cBLACKPINK will give a TV performance on September 11 and that will be the last performance for their debut single album. We\u2019re especially grateful for fans\u2019 support much greater than we expected. Even though BLACKPINK gave their performances for a period longer than originally planned, that was still not enough to fully satisfy fans, so we\u2019re really sorry. Instead, BLACKPINK will put more focus on preparation for their new songs. We believe that BLACKPINK\u2019s comeback with quality music is the way to reward for fans\u2019 support. BLACKPINK will meet fans in more diverse channels for the next album\u201d.\r\nEven though it has already been about a month since the release of \u201cWHISTLE\u201d, the song is still enjoying great popularity, taking No.1 in a TV music show. Already, BLACKPINK wrote history when they took No.1 in TV music show \u201cINKIGAYO\u201d in two weeks of their debut, the shortest-ever period of time for a rookie girl group. That proved BLACKPINK\u2019s formidable potential.\r\nThat is not all. BLACKPINK\u2019s \u201cWHISTLE\u201d is enjoying long-run popularity, staying in top ranks on Korea\u2019s biggest music-streaming website Melon. The song wrote an unprecedented record on Gaon Chart as well, taking No.1 on four of its charts including digital chart, streaming chart, and download chart. By sweeping August\u2019s Gaon chart, BLACKPINK proved their potential as a \u201cmonstrous rookie\u201d once again.\r\nBLACKPINK even took No.1 and No.2 with \u201cBOOMBAYAH\u201d and \u201cWHISTLE\u201d on American Billboard\u2019s World Digital Songs chart, going beyond Korea. Such record further raised fans\u2019 expectations for BLACKPINK\u2019s future.\r\nBLACKPINK is the most promising rookie artist of this year. BLACKPINK proved their potential as the super rookie once again, by taking No.1 on four charts of August\u2019s Gaon Chart. The four girls are firmly building their career by sweeping Gaon\u2019s digital, streaming, as well as download charts. By dominating August\u2019s monthly charts of Gaon, BLACKPINK hit the music scene by the storm again.\r\nWhat is even more notable about BLACKPINK is the fact that \u201cWHISTLE\u201d is still staying in high ranks on music charts. The song is enjoying long-run popularity, staying in high places on Korea\u2019s biggest music-streaming website Melon. Music fans are paying keen attention now to how long BLACKPINK\u2019s popularity will continue despite rush of other artists\u2019 new songs.","post_date":"2016-09-09","main_image":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/\ube14\ub799\ud551\ud06c.jpg","thumb_1x1":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/\ube14\ub799\ud551\ud06c.jpg","thumb_3x2":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/\ube14\ub799\ud551\ud06c.jpg","excerpt":"[Oh!

They beat underground rappers who disrespected idol rappers in rapper competition show \u201cShow Me the Money\u201d of Mnet, solely with their own talent. This is the story of WINNER\u2019s SONG MINHO and iKON\u2019s BOBBY who have become the icon of hip-hop.\r\n\r\nThe two\u2019s victory has exerted great influence in the music scene. After BOBBY became the winner of \u201cShow Me the Money 3\u2033 and SONG MINHO became the runner-up of \u201cShow Me the Money 4\u2033, people\u2019s perspective of idol singers has substantially changed. The two proved the fact that idol rappers are not just pretty boys who spit out a few words in a \u201ccommercially-produced\u201d boy bands. Then, they got recognized not only by the public but also by rival rappers.\r\n\r\nOf course, their talent was not built just overnight. Since the days of debut survival audition \u201cWIN\u201d aired on Mnet, the two competed against each other while working together as close colleagues, exchanging big influences.

The song is staying in top ranks on the real-time charts of a variety of music-streaming websites. .\r\nThe song boasts monstrously intense mood and mesmerizing repeat part. Its lyrics are straightforward and outspoken. Just as the lyrics that say \u201cThis song will make everyone feel drunken\u201d, BOBBY\u2019s rap and manly appeal mesmerize listeners like strong liquor.\r\nSONG MINHO is as fascinating as BOBBY. He is revealing his irresistible appeal in new song \u201cBODY\u201d released on September 8. The song is subtly and delicately appealing, just as the title itself indicates. SONG MINHO\u2019s flagship comfortable flow creates perfectly harmony, revealing his charisma. The perfect combination between rap and hook of catchy melody is also so fresh and fascinating.\u00a0\r\nThe encounter of such two differentiated artists is expected to create a big synergy.

Now, beginning from a show\u00a0on September 10\u00a0and 11 at Makuhari Messe Event Hall in Chiba, Japan, iKON will host 16 shows in six cities in Japan including Aichi, Osaka, Kobe, Fukuoka, and Tokyo, until the end of October.\r\n\r\nWINNER\u2019s SONG MINHO will perform in iKON\u2019s Japan tour as a special guest performer.\r\n\r\nBOBBY and SONG MINHO will depart to Japan for the tour on the 9, so they have to pre-record their performance for \u201cINKIGAYO\u201d to be broadcasted\u00a0on September 11.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, BOBBY\u2019s solo debut song \u201cHOLUP!\u201d released on the 7 and SONG MINHO\u2019s solo song \u201cBODY\u201d released on the 8 are enjoying big popularity on charts.","post_date":"2016-09-08","main_image":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/MOBB_3.jpg","thumb_1x1":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/MOBB_3.jpg","thumb_3x2":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/MOBB_3.jpg","excerpt":"Today (Sep, 8), SONG MINHO X BOBBY video-records performance for \u201cINKIGAYO\u201d to be aired on the 11\u2026 Departing to Japan on the 9","url_friendly_name":"today-sep-8-song-minho-x-bobby-video-records-performance-for-inkigayo-to-be-aired-on-the-11-departing-to-japan-on-the-9","artist_id":514,"related_event":[]},"1369":{"id":1369,"post_title":"BLACKPINK took No.1 on August\u2019s Gaon Chart\u2026 Living up to their nickname of \u201cmonstrous rookie\u201d","post_content":"[OSEN=\uc120\ubbf8\uacbd \uae30\uc790]\u00a0Girl group BLACKPINK\u2019s debut song \u201cWHISTLE\u201d took No.1 on August\u2019s monthly chart of Gaon Chart.\r\n\r\nAccording to Gaon Chart on September 8, BLACKPINK\u2019s \u201cWHISTLE\u201d took No.1 on the digital chart, streaming chart, and download chart for August.\r\n\r\nNo.2 in August\u2019s monthly digital chart is Standing Egg\u2019s \u201cSummer Night, You and I\u201d; No.3 is Wonder Girls\u2019 \u201cWhy So Lonely\u201d; No.4 is GFRIEND\u2019s \u201cNAVILLERA\u201d; and No.5 is Han Dong-geun\u2019s \u201cMaking a new ending for this story\u201d.\r\nNo.1 on August\u2019s Gaon albums chart is EXO\u2019s \u201cLOTTO \u2013 The 3rd Album Repackage (Korean Ver.)\u201d that has sold total 223,953 records.

As the two are the main rappers of iKON and WINNER, respectively, the two\u2019s coinciding solo comeback and competition between them have been drawing keen attention. Now that YG announced on September 5 that SONG MINHO and BOBBY are coming back on September 9 together in a unit team, not as solo artists separately, SONG MINHO and BOBBY are going to collaborate, not competing against one another.\r\nThe name of SONG MINHO and BOBBY\u2019s team is \u201cMOBB\u201d, which is combination of letters in the two\u2019s names. \u201cMob\u201d in English word \u201cflash mob\u201d means crowd, and \u201cMobb\u201d in Swedish means a rioter. The promotion for \u201cMOBB\u201d carried out for three consecutive days like a festival is all the more special and even surprising, as YG has never done such kind of promotion in the past 20 years and there has been no unit team consisting of members of different YG teams.\r\nNotably, \u201cMOBB\u201d will release four songs along with four music videos. Considering the widely-known fact that YG artists release their new songs usually behind the schedule and they even just throw completed music videos away if those videos are not satisfactory, releasing four music videos of SONG MINHO and BOBBY unit in three days in a row demonstrates how thoroughly YG has been working on the unit team\u2019s comeback for a long time.\r\nFurthermore, on September 5 at 11AM, YG Entertainment unveiled a teaser poster that announces the comeback of SONG MINHO and BOBBY\u2019s unit team on the company\u2019s official blog.\r\nThe teaser image shows \u201cMOBB\u201d, the name of the unit team of \u201cMINOXBOBBY\u201d, also saying that the team\u2019s double digital single will be released on September 9 at 0 o\u2019clock along with two music videos. In the teaser, SONG MINHO and BOBBY are looking into the camera with charismatic eyes and faces.\r\nBOBBY is the main rapper of iKON and the winner of \u201cShow Me the Money\u201d show in 2014 and SONG MINHO is the main rapper of WINNER, who was the runner-up of \u201cShow Me the Money\u201d show in 2015. The two have always been in a competing relationship from the days when they competed against each other in debut survival audition \u201cWIN\u201d before their debut, all the way up until recently. Therefore, many music fans are paying keen attention to what kind of music and performance will be presented by the two\u2019s unit team \u201cMOBB\u201d.","post_date":"2016-09-05","main_image":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/MOBB.jpg","thumb_1x1":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/MOBB.jpg","thumb_3x2":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/MOBB.jpg","excerpt":"SONG MINHO X BOBBY teamed up as \u201cMOBB\u201d\u2026 Coming back as a unit team on the 9","url_friendly_name":"song-minho-x-bobby-teamed-up-as-mobb-coming-back-as-a-unit-team-on-the-9","artist_id":514,"related_event":[]},"1143":{"id":1143,"post_title":"SONG MIN HO of WINNER to Release a Solo Single Titled \u201cBODY\u201d on September 8","post_content":"[enews24=\uc804\uc218\ubbf8 \uae30\uc790]\u00a0Following the teaser poster of BOBBY\u2019s solo single \u201cHOLUP!\u201d, the teaser image of SONG MIN HO\u2019s solo single \u201cBODY\u201d has been revealed.\r\n\r\nSONG MIN HO\u00a0will release his solo single only a day after BOBBY\u2019s solo single, which will be released on September 7.

BOBBY was the winner of Show Me The Money in 2014 and SONG MIN HO\u00a0was the runner-up in 2015, and so there always has been slight competition and tension between the two rappers.\r\n\r\nYG Entertainment commented, \u201cThey are in different groups now, but they have been close friends for years since they were trainees. BOBBY\u2019s \u201cHOLUP!\u201d is a song with a powerful beat and SONG MIN HO\u2019s \u201cBODY\u201d is a mystical sexy song with a slow beat. Because they are very different songs, you won\u2019t feel that they are competing against each other.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey went on to say, \u201cBecause they are releasing solo singles almost at the same time, they have each other to rely on when promoting their singles.\u201d\r\n\r\nSONG MIN HO\u00a0wrote the lyrics of his new single on his own and the music together with FUTURE BOUNCE.

The segment began in March 2013, and since then, world-class stars such as One Direction, Mariah Carey, Carrie Underwood, Stevie Wonder, Jennifer Hudson, Rod Stewart, Chris Martin, and Elton John appeared as guests.\r\n\r\nAfter releasing her US debut single \u201cLIFTED\u201d on August 19, CL has not been doing any promotions in the US. But with her appearance in The Late Late Show, CL is surely off to a great start.\r\n\r\nCL appearing on The Late Late Show has great meaning as only a few Korean singers such as PSY and Girls\u2019 Generation have succeeded in appearing on popular US talk shows until now. Furthermore, it means that CL will not be starting the promotions for her single at small clubs but on a nationally televised TV talk show. This is partly due to the influence of Scooter Braun, the manager of top stars such as Justin Bieber. But it is only possible because CL is quite well known in the US. CL will be doing various promotions for her new song after her appearance on The Late Late show.\r\n\r\nThe Late Late Show first aired in 1995 and has become CBS\u2019s most popular talk show. The show has posted 630 million views on Youtube so far.\r\n\r\nCL\u2019s first US single \u201cLIFTED\u201d became no.17 on Billboard\u2019s Social Chart 50 and was chosen as Apple Music\u2019s Best Of The Week Songs. Major US media outlets such as The Time, Entertainment Weekly, and USA Today published articles about CL\u2019s new US single.","post_date":"2016-09-04","main_image":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/CL-e1473453234986.jpg","thumb_1x1":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/CL-e1473453234986.jpg","thumb_3x2":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/CL-e1473453234986.jpg","excerpt":"[Exclusive] CL to Appear as a Guest on The Late Late Show","url_friendly_name":"exclusive-cl-to-appear-as-a-guest-on-the-late-late-show","artist_id":243,"related_event":[]},"962":{"id":962,"post_title":"[DUMMY DATA] TITLE PLACEHOLD-2","post_content":"Following their romantic Italian vacation, Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay Z returned stateside and managed to sneak into the Hands of Stone premiere in NYC on Monday night.

The group\u2019s song has also become a great hit outside of Korea and ranked no.1 on the iTunes charts of 14 countries, the World Digital Song Chart of Billboards, and QQ Music\u2019s K-Pop Weekly Chart.","post_date":"2016-08-19","main_image":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/BP_15.jpg","thumb_1x1":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/BP_15.jpg","thumb_3x2":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/BP_15.jpg","excerpt":"BLACKPINK\u2019s \u201cWHISTLE\u201d Climbs Back Up to No.1 on the Charts and the Dance Video Surpassed One Million Views","url_friendly_name":"blackpinks-whistle-climbs-back-up-to-no-1-on-the-charts-and-the-dance-video-surpassed-one-million-views","artist_id":602,"related_event":[]},"1263":{"id":1263,"post_title":"CL officially debuts in America on the 19\u2026 Will she break the highest record set by a Korean artist on American Billboard chart? \u2460","post_content":"CL of 2NE1 (CL, DARA, and BOM), one of the leading K-pop girl groups, is soon to unveil her first official output in the United States, the world\u2019s biggest pop music market. Music fans are paying keen attention to if she will be able to break Korean artist\u2019s highest record on American Billboard main albums chart, which is held by 2NE1.\r\n\r\nOn August 17, CL\u2019s label YG Entertainment (\u201cYG\u201d) officially announced that CL will release her first official solo single \u201cLIFTED\u201d in the United States on the 19 this month. CL has long prepared for her debut in the States, in cooperation with Scooter Braun who helped management of PSY in the States. Now, finally, CL is unveiling her first official single in the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCL\u2019s launching in the United States is drawing keen attention, as she is the first one in Korea who is from a top girl group and who tries to succeed in the world\u2019s biggest pop music market alone. People are also keenly interested in if CL will be able to break 2NE1\u2019s record of highest ranking on Billboard 200, American Billboard main albums chart, for a Korean singer. In early 2014, album \u201cCRUSH\u201d of 2NE1 for which CL is the leader took 61st rank on American Billboard\u2019s main albums chart. That is still the highest-ever record on the Billboard 200 chart for any Korean singer.\r\n\r\nCL\u2019s first official single in the States has only one song. That song is the one that will be included in her official debut album in the States. In other words, it is a lead single for CL\u2019s full-fledged debut album in the country. Therefore, the popularity of \u201cLIFTED\u201d will be the bellwether for the success of CL\u2019s official debut album in the country. So, people are showing growing interest in the record to be set by CL\u2019s lead single. CL will release some more singles after the lead single, before finally releasing her full-fledged debut album in America.\r\n\r\nThere is a high chance for CL to break 2NE1\u2019s record on Billboard 200 chart with her debut album in the States which will include the songs in her debut singles. There are a couple of reasons to expect such success for CL\u2019s debut in the States.\r\n\r\nFirst, Scooter Braun, who perfectly understands the circumstances in the pop music market in the States, will be in charge of CL\u2019s management in the country. Scooter Braun recruited world-famous pop star Justin Bieber and he is currently working for top singer Ariana Grande. In a word, Scooter Braun is one of the most powerful and influential figures in America\u2019s pop music market, so working with him will be extremely helpful for CL. The reason why CL has been able to work on her debut album in collaboration with America\u2019s famous musicians so far is largely attributable to Scooter Braun\u2019s help.\r\n\r\nCL released \u201cHELLO BITCHES\u201d, the pre-promotion song for her solo debut in the States, in November last year, to take No.1 on global music-streaming website Sportify. Such record drew even bigger attention, as it was set while many media outlets of the States and other countries were expressing their big anticipation for CL\u2019s debut in the States. That is one of the reasons why people have bigger interest in the success of CL\u2019s first debut single to be released on the 19 and her debut full album that will be released later.\r\n\r\nAnother reason why CL\u2019s debut in the States with the debut single and debut full album is believed to be promising is because she has outstanding talent in rap, vocal, and performance and is fluent in English. She can play a leading role in her own promotion in the country.\r\n\r\nIt is worthwhile to look forward to CL\u2019s successful debut in America\u2019s pop music market and the possibility for her to break her own record of the highest rank on Billboard albums chart for any Korean singer, which is still held by 2NE1.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","post_date":"2016-08-17","main_image":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/CL_2.jpg","thumb_1x1":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/CL_2.jpg","thumb_3x2":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/CL_2.jpg","excerpt":"CL officially debuts in America on the 19\u2026 Will she break the highest record set by a Korean artist on American Billboard chart? \u2460","url_friendly_name":"cl-officially-debuts-in-america-on-the-19-will-she-break-the-highest-record-set-by-a-korean-artist-on-american-billboard-chart-%e2%91%a0","artist_id":243,"related_event":[]},"1268":{"id":1268,"post_title":"BLACKPINK\u2019s First Ever \u201cWHISTLE\u201d & \u201cBOOMBAYAH\u201d Performance Hit Six Million Views","post_content":"[OSEN=\uae40\ubcf4\ub77c \uae30\uc790]\u00a0Only nine days have passed since BLACKPINK\u2019s debut, but the group is still rocking the charts.

BLACKPINK\u2019s music videos that look like blockbuster movies as YG music videos always do, are also recording big number of views.\r\n\r\nBLACKPINK\u2019s two debut songs are taking the first and second places on charts at the same time and setting unprecedentedly high records that go over the range of statistics collection repeatedly. The power and appeal that BLACKPINK presented on the day of their debut are definitely more exceptional and unprecedented than any other YG rookies.\r\n\r\nBLACKPINK drew keen attention by releasing \u201cWHISTLE\u201d and \u201cBOOMBAYAH\u201d, the double title tracks of debut single album \u201cSQUARE ONE\u201d, after four years of hard training by YG. They drew attention first by releasing music videos in the showcase held before the release of the album and then, made an official debut by releasing the debut songs.\r\n\r\n\u201cWHISTLE\u201d and \u201cBOOMBAYAH\u201d have contrasting feels. While \u201cBOOMBAYAH\u201d with a quick tempo has a cool appeal that goes well with the summer season and intense feel that triggers girl crush, \u201cWHISTLE\u201d has a catchy and dreamlike feel. Sensual scenes of the music videos of the songs also boast unique and sophisticated appeals.\r\n\r\nFirst, \u201cWHISTLE\u201d has a unique atmosphere that is bubbly and exciting but tender like a dream at the same time. It also has YG\u2019s flagship unique feel, which is well expressed by BLACKPINK\u2019s members. Along with the sexy and dreamy mood, exciting and funny expression is outstanding.\r\n\r\nROS\u00c9\u2019s vocal and JENNIE\u2019s rap in the intro part are impressive. The intro of the song has a very unique and dreamy feel and it is well expressed by ROS\u00c9\u2019s attractive voice. The voice of JENNIE who is good at both vocal and rap is also impressive. The harmony created by the combination of the four members is catchier than expected. The 808 drum sound makes listeners sing along it over and over again.\r\n\r\nThe two debut songs of BLACKPINK swept No.1 on the real-time chart of four music-streaming websites within one hour of release. With such record, BLACKPINK made an unprecedentedly successful debut.\r\n\r\nROS\u00c9 said, \u201cI\u2019m nervous as I\u2019ve longed for debut for a long time, but I\u2019ll do my best to show you everything I have learned in good performances on the stage\u201d.\r\n\r\nJENNIE said, \u201cI thank people who have waited for us with anticipation for a long time. I\u2019ll do my best to show you BLACKPINK\u2019s unique color. I hope BLACKPINK will be loved by many people\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m so much excited and nervous as I\u2019m finally making debut after a long time of training. BLACKPINK will always show you good performances\u201d, added JISOO.\r\n\r\nThen, LISA said, \u201cI\u2019m so excited to make debut with the members with whom I\u2019ve been trained for a long time. I hope many people will love BLACKPINK\u201d.\r\n\r\nBLACKPINK is a rookie girl group whose members have been hard-trained by YG for four to six years. The members have already been recognized for their outstanding talent built in the long-time training and collaboration work with YG artists.","post_date":"2016-08-09","main_image":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/BP_3.jpg","thumb_1x1":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/BP_3.jpg","thumb_3x2":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/BP_3.jpg","excerpt":"[Music Talk Talk] Who\u2019s BLACKPINK?

As BLACKPINK is a rookie girl group launched by YG for the first time in seven years with full support from the company, music fans expect that they will become a \u201cmonstrous rookie\u201d.\r\n\r\n\u201cBOOMBAYAH\u201d is a song jointly written by YG\u2019s main producer TEDDY and Bekuh BOOM. The song\u2019s music video is directed by Seo Hyeon-seung, a famous director who has directed many music videos of BIGBANG and 2NE1. \u201cBOOMBAYAH\u201d is known to be a song of an intense and quick rhythm, which is exciting enough to cool down this summer\u2019s heat wave.\r\n\r\nThe other title track is \u201cWHISTLE\u201d. YG\u2019s main producer TEDDY and Future Bounce wrote the melody and TEDDY wrote the lyrics of the song. The song boasts powerful charisma, differently from \u201cBOOMBAYAH\u201d. This minimal hip-hop song with a dreamlike and sexy feel expresses exciting love between a man and woman in the word \u201cwhistle\u201d.\r\n\r\nBLACKPINK meets the public for the first time before the official release of the new songs in a showcase at 3PM.

The short dance practice video was released online, and it was the first time the public saw BLACKPINK members as a group. The video is currently posting high views.\r\n\r\nSeven years have passed since YG Entertainment launched a new girl group. After announcing that its new girl group BLACKPINK will officially debut on August 8, YG released BLACKPINK\u2019s dance practice video on July 21. The video, which features all the members of BLACKPINK dancing passionately, posted one million views in just a day after its release. Then, it surpassed two million views in three days, three million in nine days, and four million in two weeks. The rapidly rise in the video\u2019s views demonstrate the group\u2019s popularity.\r\n\r\nIndeed, BLACKPINK is going viral worldwide. Fans around the world are sending their support for JISOO, JENNIE, ROS\u00c9, and LISA by posting dance covers and reaction videos online.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s rare that a rookie receives so much spotlight. From July 1, the profile of members had been released one by one every week, and thanks to the members\u2019 gorgeous looks, which is unusual for YG artists, fans have been anticipating to see them. The view is that YG has succeeded in forming a group with members that have both the talent and the looks. The fact that YG\u2019s main producer TEDDY was put in charge of producing BLACKPINK\u2019s album only raised the expectations even more.\r\n\r\nIn a way, YG is very cheeky. Today, there are so many idol groups, and other labels are launching groups that have diverse members, much like confectionary boxes. But, YG is going to launch a four-member group. Idol groups nowadays consist of at least five members, and some of them as much as 12 or 13, but YG is jumping into the game only with a selected few.\r\n\r\nThe group\u2019s name also shows the group\u2019s identity. The name \u201cBLACKPINK\u201d combines black and pink, which represent special and universal, respectively. So, the name reflects that four members, who are as pretty as the color pink, have infinite potential, uniqueness, and charisma as the color black.\r\n\r\nBLACKPINK\u2019s debut singles, \u201cBOOMBAYAH\u201d and \u201cWHISTLE\u201d, and the songs\u2019 music videos are to be released at 8 PM on August 8. Earlier in the day at 3 PM, a showcase will be held, and BLACKPINK members will appear before the public for the first time. The showcase will be broadcasted live on Naver V App.","post_date":"2016-08-07","main_image":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/BP_5.jpg","thumb_1x1":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/BP_5.jpg","thumb_3x2":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/BP_5.jpg","excerpt":"[Music Talk Talk] Dance Practice of YG\u2019s BLACKPINK Surpasses 6 Million Views","url_friendly_name":"music-talk-talk-dance-practice-of-ygs-blackpink-surpasses-6-million-views","artist_id":602,"related_event":[]},"1262":{"id":1262,"post_title":"\u201cYG rookie never fails expectations\u201d\u2026 BLACKPINK\u2019s dance practice video already recording three million views\u2026 \u201cDrawing keen attention from around the world\u201d","post_content":"[OSEN=\uc120\ubbf8\uacbd \uae30\uc790]\u00a0YG Entertainment\u2019s new girl group BLACKPINK\u2019s first dance practice video has surpassed three million views.\r\n\r\nAs of today (July 14) at 9AM, BLACKPINK\u2019s group dance practice video recorded 3,062,804 views within 9 days of release, proving the team\u2019s big popularity which is very unusual for a rookie who has not even made official debut.\r\n\r\nNotably, the video is showing a rapid growth in the number of views, after reaching one million within a day of release, then two million in three days, and three million in 14 days.

However, two years ago, YG\u2019s head YANG HYUN SUK changed the plan to make four of them debut first. \u00a0\r\n\r\nEven though what YANG has in his mind is not clear as of now, the rest of the five trainees are still working at YG.

Under the name of \u201cMADE\u201d series, BIGBANG released a single album with more than one song every month for four months until August that year. Wondering about the outcome? Every song swept music charts upon its release and music fans could see unusual phenomenon of BIGBANG songs taking top places on charts away from other BIGBANG songs.\r\nAfter making the long-awaited comeback, BIGBANG went off for their second world tour beginning from a concert in Seoul. BIGBANG who stood before fans as a complete team after a long time of absence made much effort to present more perfect performances. In order to show perfectly flawless performances, all the members actively took part in the preparation, from the very beginning. As the members themselves had such high expectations for the tour, they felt bigger disappointment when things did not turn out as planned. The hard-work put in the preparation of BIGBANG\u2019s tour concert is all vividly demonstrated in movie \u201cBIGBANG MADE\u201d.\r\nBIGBANG members encouraged concert staff and sometimes, they gave bitter criticism for a better concert. They tried to take care of every single detail including whether to call the city they were in \u201cLA\u201d or \u201cOC\u201d. As a result, fans acclaimed everything BIGBANG showed on the stage. The images of the concert in movie \u201cMADE\u201d give a chance to experience the heat of the concert, though indirectly.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe gets upset when I do it. That looks really cute\u201d\r\nDocumentary film \u201cBIGBANG MADE\u201d also demonstrates BIGBANG\u2019s fun everyday lives, not just their performances on the stage. All the members are professionals who have been standing on the stage for 11 years when performing, but in their everyday lives, they are Gwon Ji-yong, Dong Young-bae, Choi Seung-hyun, Kang Daesung, and Lee Seung-hyun, men in their twenties who give off different appeals.\r\nThey made jokes on one another in waiting room, taking video of other members in shower, saying some bad words to others\u2019 naughty jokes. When they were shooting the music video of \u201cWE LIKE 2 PARTY\u201d while drunken in Jeju Island, they looked just like mischievous boys travelling and playing with friends.\r\nThe members were like family for the staff and the closest and dearest friends for each other, who are going through the most shining chapter in their lives together. That is well-displayed in the honest conversations and interviews of the members, in \u201cBIGBANG MADE\u201d.\r\n\u201cI thought these days would never come again\u201d\r\nBIGBANG openly talked about some sensitive and heavy topics as well, in movie \u201cBIGBANG MADE\u201d. They answered to questions about the renewal of the contract with the current label as well as BIGBANG\u2019s future, which are the questions about which fans are most curious.\r\nWhen BIGBANG came back to the music scene after a long-time absence, the issue of BIGBANG\u2019s choice was raised. Many people paid keen attention to whether BIGBANG will renew their contract with YG Entertainment. However, in last November, BIGBANG decided to stay with YG Entertainment, saying that \u201cWe have never thought of leaving YG, as it is like our home\u201d. Even though it is true that there have been some moments of crisis so far, the members reached an agreement to stably maintain the team.\r\nBIGBANG members also opened talked about what they felt like about their imminent military service. Nobody knows when the members could stand on the stage as a complete team again. The members said that they worked even harder to give a good memory for foreign fans, as they don\u2019t know when they could see overseas fans again.\r\nAs such, \u201cBIGBANG MADE\u201d depicts the life of the top idol group who celebrates the 10th\u00a0anniversary of their debut, as well as the daily lives of the members of the group who are also young men living their lives with fierce efforts. The movie openly talks about BIGBANG\u2019s true hearts to look back the past 10 years of BIGBANG\u2019s history and to make fans have even bigger expectations for the next 10 years. The movie will be released to the general public on June 30.\u00a0","post_date":"2016-06-29","main_image":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/201606290614022421323_20160629061441_01_99_20160629063103.jpg","thumb_1x1":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/201606290614022421323_20160629061441_01_99_20160629063103.jpg","thumb_3x2":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/201606290614022421323_20160629061441_01_99_20160629063103.jpg","excerpt":"[Pop-up Review] \u201cBIGBANG MADE\u201d, #performance #members #future of BIGBANG who celebrates the 10th anniversary of debut","url_friendly_name":"pop-up-review-bigbang-made-performance-members-future-of-bigbang-who-celebrates-the-10th-anniversary-of-debut","artist_id":454,"related_event":[]},"1917":{"id":1917,"post_title":"[OSEN=\ubc15\uc18c\uc601 \uae30\uc790] You can finally listen to these songs as much as you want.

She has yet to debut officially in China, but already great attention is being paid to her. China\u2019s music charts are already responding. YG Entertainment\u2019s soul princess, LEE HI, has captivated Chinese fans.\r\nOn 25 April, according to China\u2019s largest music streaming website QQ Music chart, \u201cMY STAR\u201d, which is the title song of LEE HI\u2019s full album \u201cSEOULITE\u201d, topped its new songs chart.\r\nAlong with this, \u201cHOLD MY HAND\u201d, her double title track in the half album released last month, topped QQ Music\u2019s K-pop weekly chart. The song continued to take over the chart even though a month has passed since its release.\r\n\u201cMY STAR\u201d is a retro-soul song, written and composed by YG\u2019s main producers Teddy and Kush. Fans in Korea and abroad love this song as the song highlights LEE HI\u2019s unique soulful voice and groove.\r\nTogether with the song, \u201cMY STAR\u201d music video is also being loved by many Chinese fans, taking the second place on the K-pop music video chart. Both her music video and song are captivating Chinese fans.\r\nIndeed, China had been paying much attention to LEE HI, even before her debut in Korea. When she was being featured in SBS \u2018K-pop Star Season 1\u2019, Chinese netizens cheered for her and supported her.\r\nThis was largely thanks to her soulful voice that is not very common in the Chinese pop music scene. Her unique voice full of emotions, her groovy addictive music and her cute stage manners were enough to fascinate Chinese fans.\r\nIf this trend continues, LEE HI may have to debut in China. Just in four years after her debut in Korea, both Korean and Chinese fans are having their eye on LEE HI.

BIGBANG who celebrates the 10th anniversary of their debut this year is still at the top and numerous rivals have come and gone so far. Such trend is not confined to Korea, but is spreading overseas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIGBANG decided to add one more concert to their two-day concert at Osaka Yamma Stadium Nagai\u00a0on July 30\u00a0and 31 which will be held in celebration of BIGBANG\u2019s 10th anniversary. The number of audience was expected at 110,000, but fans\u2019 big interest in the concert made the number increase to 165,000. That is a truly impressive scale.\r\n\r\nBIGBANG successfully rounded off world tour that drew total 911,000 fans in Japan from November last year to February this year. BIGBANG is the first foreign artist in Japan who has held tour in the country for three years in a row. That proves the unrivaled popularity BIG is enjoying in Japan.\r\n\r\nThat was not the end. BIGBANG\u2019s stadium concert scheduled for this July is creating sensation again, proving BIGBANG\u2019s nickname \u201cGOD-bang\u201d.\r\n\r\nPlus, BIGBANG kicked off fan club event tour in Japan two years after the last fan meeting tour and has been carrying out arena tour with 27 concerts in four cities: including one at Kobe World Memorial Hall from April 22 to 24 and another one at the same place\u00a0from May 27\u00a0to 29.\r\n\r\nOther than performances as complete team BIGBANG, each member of the team has also established their own artistic presence in a variety of fields. It is true that Korean fans are rather dissatisfied with the fact that they can hardly see team BIGBANG in Korea because of their hectic overseas schedule. However, that is kind of unavoidable fate for fans of such global star.\r\n\r\nBIGBANG is enjoying such unending popularity for as long as ten years. There seems to be nobody who could ever replace BIGBANG\u2019s \u201cunprecented\u201d success.\r\n\r\n\r\n","post_date":"2016-04-25","main_image":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/201604251510779368_571db5709b5cc_99_20160425151704.jpg","thumb_1x1":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/201604251510779368_571db5709b5cc_99_20160425151704.jpg","thumb_3x2":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/201604251510779368_571db5709b5cc_99_20160425151704.jpg","excerpt":"[Music Talk Talk] BIGBANG at top for \u201c10 years\u201d, irreplaceable & undeniable","url_friendly_name":"music-talk-talk-bigbang-at-top-for-10-years-irreplaceable-undeniable","artist_id":454,"related_event":[]},"2036":{"id":2036,"post_title":"[Look @ Japan] \u201c160,000 for 3 days\u201d\u2026 What is the power of BIGBANG sweeping Japan?","post_content":"[TV\ub9ac\ud3ec\ud2b8=\uc774\uc9c0\ud638 \uac1d\uc6d0\uae30\uc790]\u00a0What would be the limit of BIGBANG\u2019s draw of audience?\r\nBIGBANG has decided to add one more concert to their tour. BIGBANG is to hold stadium live concert on July 30 and 31 at Osaka Yanma Stadium in Osaka, Japan, in celebration of the 10th\u00a0anniversary of the team\u2019s debut. The predicted number of audience was 110,000. However, more than 450,000 tickets were applied for, so BIGBANG decided to hold one more concert on July 29. Therefore, the concert will draw total 165,000 fans for three days.\u00a0\r\nBIGBANG successfully rounded off Japan dome tour from November last year to February this year, drawing 911,000 fans in Japan. That was an unprecedented record for a foreign singer, which was fifth highest number of audience for concerts ever held in Japan.\r\nIt has been barely half a year after the end of such large-scale tour concert, but BIGBANG is holding another large-scale concert that will draw 160,000 people. That is not all. Starting from this month, BIGBANG will have total 27 fan club events in their tour in four cities. With such hectic schedule, BIGBANG is now approaching toward the climax of their tour in Japan, the concert at stadium. Then, how come are that many people flocking to BIGBANG\u2019s concert?\r\nBIGBANG\u2019s biggest strength picked by Japanese fans at BIGBANG concert is the fact that \u201cBIGBANG\u2019s songs are really good\u201d. When compared with other idol singers, BIGBANG\u2019s songs and performances are outstanding, even if other idol singers also have many strengths.\r\nJapanese fans also think highly of BIGBANG\u2019s originality and creativity. BIGBANG has a clearly distinctive character different from other idol groups and singers, which is sophisticated and cool. Not only BIGBANG\u2019s music but also their fashion and performances on the stage are on the vanguard of latest trend.\r\nActually, BIGBANG is thought to be the \u201cstar of the stars\u201d in Japan. Many Japanese celebrities come to watch BIGBANG concerts: Japan\u2019s top models and actresses including Mizuhara Kiko, Komatsu Nana, and Takei Emi have proclaimed to be BIGBANG\u2019s fans. Those Japanese stars post photos on their social media accounts after visiting BIGBANG concert, and that becomes part of motivation for young people in Japan to visit BIGBANG\u2019s concert.\r\nConcert itself is acclaimed by Japanese fans as well. Fans who have watched BIGBANG concert once comes to see BIGBANG again and again every year. A Japanese fan said after watching BIGBANG concert, \u201cI was really pleased, maybe because BIGBANG sang a lot of exciting songs. I jumped a lot, so I\u2019m exhausted now. I want to visit BIGBANG concert again\u201d.\r\nPerformances at the concert are of course good and another strength of BIGBANG concert is the team\u2019s sincere fan service, according to Japanese fans. Japanese Nikkan Sports praised BIGBANG\u2019s concert held in February by saying, \u201cDisciplined dance, powerful singing, as well as charming remarks in not-that-good Japanese are the great draw of BIGBANG concert. They never stop trying to entertain Japanese fans\u201d.\r\nThe harmony between outstanding talent, good look and personality, and hard-work of BIGBANG has enabled the team to enjoy ever-rising popularity for the 10 years since their debut.\r\nThis year is the last year for BIGBANG to perform in a complete team before the members go to serve their mandatory military service. Even if the five members join the army on the same day, for two years at least, fans will not be able to see them on the stage. That is another reason why more Japanese fans are flocking to BIGBANG concert in order to see complete team BIGBANG one more time.","post_date":"2016-04-25","main_image":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/20160307_1457276634_84761900_1_99_20160425134505.jpg","thumb_1x1":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/20160307_1457276634_84761900_1_99_20160425134505.jpg","thumb_3x2":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/20160307_1457276634_84761900_1_99_20160425134505.jpg","excerpt":"[Look @ Japan] \u201c160,000 for 3 days\u201d\u2026 What is the power of BIGBANG sweeping Japan?","url_friendly_name":"look-japan-160000-for-3-days-what-is-the-power-of-bigbang-sweeping-japan","artist_id":454,"related_event":[]},"2038":{"id":2038,"post_title":"AKMU confirmed on their comeback on May 4\u2026 Title of the album is \u201cSPRING\u201d","post_content":"\r\n\r\n[OSEN=\uc815\uc18c\uc601 \uae30\uc790]\u00a0AKDONG MUSICIAN (AKMU) is coming back after one year and six months of absence from the music scene.
