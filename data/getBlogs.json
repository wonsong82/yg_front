To reward fans\u2019 big support given at their first concert in 16 years since the team\u2019s disbandment, SECHSKIES voluntarily decided to work during the holidays, in order to give a bigger momentum for the finishing work on their new songs.\r\n\r\nRookie girl group BLACKPINK is working during the holidays as well. BLACKPINK recently gave the last performance for their debut single album in SBS \u201cINKIGAYO\u201d. The team will shoot the music video of their new song on September 14 and 15, too, in order to come back faster than originally scheduled.\r\n\r\nAs such, SECHSKIES and BLACKPINK shoot music videos on the same days. According to insiders, YG Entertainment\u2019s CEO YANG HYUN SUK spared no support for those two teams, by appointing famous music video directors who have mainly produced BIGBANG\u2019s music videos to direct their new music videos.\r\n\r\nAs the timeline of the new release and comeback of SECHSKIES and BLACKPINK has not been confirmed yet, who will come back first between the two teams will depend on the speed of their final work on new songs and music videos.\r\n\r\nSECHSKIES proved their still-big popularity and opened a new chapter in their music career by holding the first concert in 16 years recently, while BLACKPINK has emerged as a \u201cformidable rookie\u201d by making unprecedented achievements on charts and TV music shows. Music fans are now paying keen attention to the outcome of the two team\u2019s hard work even during the holidays.","post_date":"2016-09-13","related_blog":[854],"main_image":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/201609121136777533_57d6165e5b740_99_20160913075904.jpg","thumb_2x1":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/201609121136777533_57d6165e5b740_99_20160913075904.jpg","thumb_3x2":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/201609121136777533_57d6165e5b740_99_20160913075904.jpg"},"1689":{"id":1689,"post_title":"MINO&BOBBY Talk about Dating, \u201c\u2026want to have much experience, but realistically speaking, it\u2019s impossible\u201d","url_friendly_name":"minobobby-talk-about-dating-want-to-have-much-experience-but-realistically-speaking-its-impossible","excerpt":"","post_content":"[\ud5e4\ub7f4\ub4dcPOP=\ubc15\uc218\uc778 \uae30\uc790]\u00a0MINO and BOBBY talk about dating.\r\nDuring their interview, which took place at the YG Building in Mapo-gu, Seoul at 2 PM on September 12, MOBB talked about dating.\r\nBOBBY said, \u201cI\u2019m not saying dating isn\u2019t important.

What is all the more special is that he is fully enjoying his good fortune even before the time when it was destined. It has been revealed that G-DRAGON was born with an unmatched predestined fame and wealth.\r\n\r\nOn September 7 at 7PM, G-DRAGON hosted NAVER special V-APP live-broadcasting \u201cG-DRAGON ON-AIR\u201d. BIGBANG members have done individual live-broadcasting once every week since the end of last month. DAESUNG was the first one to do the live-broadcasting and G-DRAGON was the second to follow DAESUNG.\r\n\r\nG-DRAGON said he \u201chas lots of concerns these days\u201d and invited a fortune-teller to read his destiny. The fortune-teller said that G-DRAGON was destined to have big fame and wealth. The fortune-teller also said that G-DRAGON\u2019s luck for wealth is especially great from this September to December and he will also meet a new person who will greatly help him during the period.\r\n\r\nThe lines on GD\u2019s palms were exceptionally good as well, to surprise the fortune-teller. The line of longevity is long, being cut nowhere in the middle. Plus, the \u201cM\u201d shape on his palms indicates GD is a man of wealth. The fortune-teller said the lines of GD\u2019s palms are the ones for \u201cthe king of wealth\u201d and G-DRAGON could not stop smiling.\r\n\r\nThe fortune-teller extolled G-DRAGON\u2019s fortune, saying, \u201cYou will have an extraordinarily good luck until early 50s\u201d. The fortune-teller also recognized G-DRAGON\u2019s natural talent, saying, \u201cYour physiognomy can be compared to half-crane and half-swallow. It says that you\u2019re full of talent and charms\u201d.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThen, the fortune-teller gave a list of lucky items for G-DRAGON. He gave advice to GD, saying, \u201cNumber 1, 3, 6, 8 and color black, blue, navy, and green are good for you. Put on clothes with tiger printing on it, or a wooden ring\u201d.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe fortune-teller said that the lucky season for GD is spring and winter and G-DRAGON was reminded of his song \u201cBLUE\u201d, because the song has lyrics that go \u201cthe winter goes and spring comes\u201d. Plus, the title of the song \u201cBLUE\u201d was something good for him, so G-DRAGON made a big smile.\r\n\r\nThe fortune-teller recommended caf\u00e9 and fancy goods business for G-DRAGON. G-DRAGON was surprised by such recommendation and said, \u201cActually, I run a caf\u00e9 in Jeju Island and I will collaborate with a clothing brand soon\u201d. As such, G-DRAGON is doing what is good for him without knowing his destiny in advance. The fortune-teller praised G-DRAGON by saying, \u201cYou know what is good for you instinctively, so I don\u2019t think you should care about your fortune\u201d. G-DRAGON made a satisfied smile.\r\n\r\nEven though G-DRAGON was born with the destiny to become extremely famous and wealthy, he is modest about himself. When the fortune-teller said, \u201cYou should try acting career, like as a school principal or professor\u201d, GD answered, \u201cI\u2019ve really never thought of acting as my career\u201d and said he would act only in his music videos.\r\n\r\nPlus, when the fortune-teller said that G-DRAGON\u2019s luck for this year is really good, GD said, \u201cBIGBANG album must be released within 2016, then. Not much time is left, so I\u2019ll hurry up and release the album within this year no matter what\u201d.\r\n\r\nG-DRAGON will enjoy a really good luck at the age of 35 and then will accumulate wealth consistently until his early 50s. He is a natural-born super star, but he will go even higher with his own hard-work.","post_date":"2016-09-08","related_blog":[],"main_image":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/GD_2.jpg","thumb_2x1":false,"thumb_3x2":false},"1375":{"id":1375,"post_title":"[People is] Whole new SONG MINHO\u2026 Is he going to join the ranks of sexy solo male artists?","url_friendly_name":"people-is-whole-new-song-minho-is-he-going-to-join-the-ranks-of-sexy-solo-male-artists","excerpt":"","post_content":"[\uc77c\uac04\uc2a4\ud3ec\uce20=\uc774\ubbf8\ud604 \uae30\uc790]\u00a0A new sexy male solo artist has been born.\r\n\r\nGroup WINNER\u2019s SONG MINHO fully revealed his manly sex appeal with his solo debut song \u201cBODY\u201d.

He sings the feelings and memories for ex-girlfriend in a sensual atmosphere.\r\nSONG MINHO\u2019s sex appeal reaches its climax, while he expresses a man\u2019s feelings.

In the video, SONG MINHO hugs a woman in a room, and kisses her in a swimming pool. His perfectly manly face and body shown in a shower scene reveals sex appeal which is somewhat different from the image he has shown so far.\r\nSONG MINHO co-wrote the melody and lyrics of \u201cBODY\u201d with other songwriters.

As they are held in Itaewon, the events will be free, easy, and passionate just as Itaewon is.\u00a0\r\nBefore MOBB\u2019s official duo debut, BOBBY released his solo single \u201cHOLUP!\u201d on September 7 at 0AM and SONG MINHO released his solo track \u201cBODY\u201d on September 8 at 0AM. \u201cHOLUP!\u201d is enjoying big popularity for BOBBY\u2019s flagship rough and tough rapping, while \u201cBODY\u201d is also drawing popularity for its dreamy and sexy feel, different from \u201cHOLUP!\u201d.\u00a0\r\nNot only hip-hop lovers but also general music fans are paying keen attention to those two songs.

However, the rappers don\u2019t seem to care about how their songs will do on the charts. An YG official commented that they are already very satisfied with their songs.\r\n\r\nOn September 6, YG told OSEN, \u201cHow will they do on the charts? We don\u2019t expect much as people are really into ballads and not hiphop these days. From the artist\u2019s perspective, good music is music that the audience can really enjoy. It\u2019s been such a long time since we released powerful hiphop songs. We hope that they can bring their explosive energy to the stage.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s more important than what YG thinks is what BOBBY and MINO think. It turns out that they just want to go up on the stage as soon as possible and don\u2019t really care about the chart results. The YG official explained, \u201cThey are already satisfied with the quality of the songs and the music videos. BOBBY said he can\u2019t wait to go on the stage. They will appear on this week\u2019s Inkigayo and then perform the songs on stage during the Japan arena tour.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe triple blow of BOBBY, MINO, and BOBBY&amp;MINO\u2019s MOBB will begin on September 7. BOBBY\u2019s first solo single \u201cHOLUP!\u201d will be released at 12 AM on September 7 and MINO\u2019s \u201cBODY\u201d exactly 24 hours later. Then, at 12 AM on September 9, MOBB\u2019s \u201cHIT ME\u201d and \u201cFULL HOUSE\u201d will be revealed. Also, a total of four music videos will be released. Fans are about to receive a series of presents from YG, and it almost feels like Christmas has arrived early this year.\r\n\r\nThis is a big project even for YG. No label has released four songs and four music videos in just three days. It is also the first time that members from different YG groups joined hands to form a unit group.\r\n\r\nThey are releasing the songs that they have worked so hard for almost at the same time, but they are still not worried about the chart results. Maybe this is possible because they are BOBBY and MINO, and of course, because they are YG.","post_date":"2016-09-06","related_blog":[],"main_image":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/YG.jpg","thumb_2x1":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/YG.jpg","thumb_3x2":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/YG.jpg"},"969":{"id":969,"post_title":"[Exclusive] YG is pouring all its capabilities in the second half of this year\u201d\u2026 The timetable of YG artists\u2019 comebacks and new releases","url_friendly_name":"exclusive-yg-is-pouring-all-its-capabilities-in-the-second-half-of-this-year-the-timetable-of-yg-artists-comebacks-and-new-releases","excerpt":"","post_content":"\r\n\r\n[OSEN=\ucd5c\ub098\uc601 \uc120\ubbf8\uacbd \uae40\ubcf4\ub77c \uae30\uc790]\u00a0YG Entertainment (\u201cYG\u201d) will take the second half of this year by the storm. A variety of musicians cherished and polished by YG will release their all-time best albums in the second half, doing their best.\r\nAn YG insider said on August 30 to OSEN, \u201cYG\u2019s CEO YANG HYUN SUK is taking initiative for YG\u2019s unprecedented success for the second half of this year, saying we should pour all our power and capabilities in the second half of this year, to carry out as many projects of YG artists as possible, for the sake of fans\u201d. Before such plan was announced, YG led the debut of BLACKPINK, YG\u2019s first new girl group in seven years, to a great success and announced solo album release by iKON\u2019s member BOBBY, to draw keen attention. As BOBBY is one of the leading rappers of YG, his album is expected to contain genuine hip-hop.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAfter BLACKPINK and BOBBY, WINNER\u2019s SONG MINHO who is famous for his flagship hip-hop soul, will also come back as a solo artist. Then, in fall, new albums of WINNER and iKON, the brother boy groups, are expected to be released. Then, \u201cMADE\u201d album of BIGBANG, YG\u2019s leading artist, will be finally completed.\u00a0\r\nFurthermore, AKMU will release an album in this fall as suggested from early this year, and then PSY, EPIK HIGH, and LEE HI will also release their new songs within this year. With YG\u2019s jewel box widely opening as such, global music fans will be able to enjoy a variety of YG music during the second half of this year.\u00a0\r\n\r\nPlus, Zion.T who has recently joined YG producer TEDDY\u2019s new black label, as well as Hyuk Oh of EPIK HIGH\u2019s label are likely to release new albums in the second half. As Zion.T and Hyuk Oh always sweep top places on charts, their new release is something that music fans always await for.\u00a0\r\nIf new songs and albums of such bigshot YG artists are released one after another from this September until the end of this year, the music scene for the second half of 2016 will be dominated by YG. Naturally, music fans believe that a big sensation will be created by YG during that time.\u00a0\r\n\r\nYG artists are famous for their long-time work on new songs. That is why fans of YG artists sometimes say that you never know when they will actually release an album until the album is really put on the market. However, that is also the proof of how much YG artists work hard for their music to be presented to the public.\u00a0\r\nTherefore, YG artists always present music with higher-than-expected quality. If only more than half of those YG artists release new songs in the second half, the music scene will be just hit hard by YG.\u00a0\r\n\r\n# Sechs Kies\u2019 first concert in 16 years\r\nSechs Kies will hold a concert on September 10 and 11 at Olympic Gymnastics Arena in Seoul. That is Sechs Kies\u2019 first concert in 16 years since the team\u2019s breakup in 2000. Sechs Kies had originally been supposed to hold a concert in June, but after signing contract with YG, the team decided to postpone the concert, to have more time to raise the quality of the concert. In the concert whose tickets had been all sold out right after the ticket opening, Sechs Kies is highly likely to unveil their new songs.\u00a0\r\nSechs Kies members are going to YG\u2019s recording studio every day these days. Despite their busy schedules of preparation for the concert and appearance in TV shows, Sechs Kies has been recording more than 20 songs to be performed at the concert from scratch. As Sechs Kies has not performed for more than 16 years, there were only one or two available accompanying music. No one had the accompanying music for Sechs Kies\u2019 songs and YG does not use music for TV shows at concerts, in order to present perfect sound for concerts. So, Sechs Kies members had to sing and record those songs all over again. It demonstrates how much YG is caring for the quality of Sechs Kies\u2019 concert.\r\n\r\n# Solo BOBBY &amp; iKON\u00a0\r\niKON\u2019s member and rapper BOBBY unveiled the first teaser image for his solo comeback on August 29. The teaser image showed \u201cCOMING SOON\u201d in large font, suggesting that BOBBY\u2019s solo album will be released soon. BOBBY is the main rapper of iKON who debuted one year ago, as well as the winner of Mnet\u2019s \u201cShow Me the Money 3\u201d show in 2014. BOBBY\u2019s rap style with his flagship rough and tough voice always presents energetic performances.\u00a0\r\nBOBBY is 20-years-old. He is a member of boy group iKON that holds Japan arena tour within only one year of their debut and now, he also releases his own solo album, rapidly evolving into an artist. He was 19-years-old when he won \u201cShow Me the Money 3\u201d. BOBBY\u2019s solo album and performances to be unveiled two years after that are likely to be focusing on genuine hip-hop that best-displays BOBBY\u2019s identity and appeals. Meanwhile, group iKON is also working on their new songs.\u00a0\r\n\r\n# BLACKPINK, again\r\nIs BLACKPINK, the hottest girl group of these days, going to hit the music scene hard once again? YG artists usually present more than two songs for their debut. BLACKPINK made debut only three weeks ago, but they are setting unprecedented records on charts, unlike usual rookie girl groups. BLACKPINK has been sweeping the charts of music-streaming websites for 15 days in a row, took No.1 in a TV music show within the shortest-ever period of time for a girl group, and their music videos have surpassed 20 million views. Just a \u201cwhistle\u201d of these girls is creating sensation in the music scene.\u00a0\r\nBLACKPINK has completed the formula that an YG rookie equals a monstrous rookie. Following the great success of WINNER who debuted in 2014 and iKON who debuted last year, BLACKPINK is also creating big sensation in the music scene. All those three idol groups took music charts by the storm upon their debut. These days, it is even hard for an idol group to make their debut song enter the chart. Therefore, BLACKPINK\u2019s success on charts is all the more remarkable.\u00a0\r\n\r\n# Hyuk Oh and CL\u00a0\r\nHyuk Oh drew big attention by presenting a sensational performance at SUMMER SONIC 2016, one of the leading music festivals in Japan. Hyuk Oh is holding a concert in Japan and then coming back to Korea to concentrate on their new album. Hyuk Oh was acclaimed by the audience for their performance at 2016 SUMMER SONIC FESTIVAL on August 20 and 21. Now, music fans are expressing bigger anticipation for Hyuk Oh\u2019s comeback with new songs.\u00a0\r\nPlus, CL (Lee Chae-lin)\u2019s solo debut single is drawing big attention not only in Korea but also around the world. After establishing a base camp in the United States early last year and announcing her full-fledged debut in the country, CL has been collaborating with world-famous artists and the collaboration projects have been spotlighted by globally influential media outlets. That is why many people show rising anticipation and interest in CL\u2019s first step in America\u2019s music scene.\u00a0\r\n\r\n# Solo SONG MINHO &amp; WINNER\r\nAlong with BOBBY to release a solo album soon, WINNER\u2019s member SONG MINHO is also to make a solo comeback soon. As the two have boasted great talent as the rappers of WINNER and iKON, as well as in \u201cShow Me the Money\u201d competition, fans have high expectations for their solo music. SONG MINHO has also contributed his solo song in WINNER\u2019s album. Just like iKON and BOBBY, WINNER is also working on their new songs, in line with SONG MINHO\u2019s solo comeback.\u00a0\r\nNotably, since the time of SONG MINHO\u2019s comeback and BOBBY\u2019s solo comeback overlap, the competition between the two will draw much attention. The relationship between WINNER and iKON is so special, as they competed against each other in survival audition shows for debut. The two are even called \u201cbrother idol groups\u201d. Coinciding solo comebacks of the main rappers of two idol boy groups that target fan base of similar age group is a very exceptional and unusual case in Korea\u2019s music scene. The constructive competition between the two is expected to create a big synergy. \u00a0\r\n2016. 8. 30.","post_date":"2016-08-31","related_blog":[],"main_image":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/201608300832773248_57c4d2f4c69b1_99_20160830092804.jpg","thumb_2x1":false,"thumb_3x2":false},"967":{"id":967,"post_title":"iKON\u2019s BOBBY reveals his upper body to boast manly appeal\u2026 In second teaser for his solo comeback","url_friendly_name":"ikons-bobby-reveals-his-upper-body-to-boast-manly-appeal-in-second-teaser-for-his-solo-comeback","excerpt":"","post_content":"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[OSEN=\uc120\ubbf8\uacbd \uae30\uc790]\u00a0Boy group iKON\u2019s BOBBY who will soon release a solo album unveiled the second teaser image.\r\n\r\nYG Entertainment unveiled the second teaser image for BOBBY\u2019s solo comeback on the company\u2019s official blog YG LIFE, on August 30 at 10AM, to draw keen attention.\r\n\r\nIn the two photos in the teaser image, BOBBY is revealing his firm upper body with six-pack abs, with his calm eyes looking into the camera.

A day before, YG had revealed the teaser poster of BLACKPINK\u2019s first debut single \u201cBOOMBAYAH\u201d, attracting much attention from the public.\r\n\r\nIn the teaser poster of \u201cBOOMBAYAH\u201d, members looked fierce retaining the signature look of YG\u2019s female artists. The members look sexy and charismatic in the teaser poster for \u201cWHISTLE\u201d. Posing under a chandelier, BLACKPINK members show their unique charm and force.\r\n\r\nAn YG official commented, \u201c\u2019WHISTLE\u2019 is a song about the fluttering emotion between lovers, and the word \u2018whistle\u2019 is a metaphorical expression of such emotion. It is a minimalistic hip-hop song that is sexy and hypnotizing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe song is made by YG\u2019s main producer TEDDY and FUTURE BOUNCE and written by TEDDY. YG announced earlier on that \u201cBOOMBAYAH\u201d is a fast-tempo song with a strong beat, and now that the title of BLACKPINK\u2019s second debut song has been revealed, fans are anticipating their debut more than ever.\u00a0\r\n\r\nYG collaborated with VM Project to make the music video for \u201cWHISTLE\u201d, and it is said that YG was so satisfied with the results that YG proposed doing BOBBY and SONG MINHO\u2019s project together.\r\n\r\nBLACKPINK\u2019s long-awaited debut is drawing near and expectations are running high. The teaser posters of each member and all of them together have served to raise the expectations in the run up to their debut on August 8.\r\n\r\nThe average age of BLACKPINK members is 19, and all the members have gone through rigorous training at YG from at least four to as much as six years. Their talent and beauty have been demonstrated in the teaser posters and BLACKPINK\u2019s dance practice video, which surpassed five million views. BLACKPINK members are also fluent in Korean, English, Japanese, and Thai, which will enable them to go beyond Korea and succeed in the global market.\r\n\r\nYG had announced that it plans to release the tracks of BLACKPINK\u2019s debut album one by one and not at the same time and make music videos for all of them as it has taken more than two years to make the album. This shows YG\u2019s confidence in the album, and soon we will be able to find out whether or not they had a good reason to feel confident when \u201cBOOMBAYAH\u201d and \u201cWHISTLE\u201d get released.\r\n\r\n2016. 8. 6.","post_date":"2016-08-30","related_blog":[],"main_image":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/201608061612776214_57a58e75087d5_99_20160806161603.jpg","thumb_2x1":false,"thumb_3x2":false},"951":{"id":951,"post_title":"BLACKPINK Releases Sexy & Fierce Countdown Poster with Only One Day to Go Until its Debut","url_friendly_name":"blackpink-releases-sexy-fierce-countdown-poster-with-only-one-day-to-go-until-its-debut","excerpt":"","post_content":"\r\n[\uc2a4\ud3ec\uce20\uc870\uc120=\uc870\uc724\uc120 \uae30\uc790]\u00a0In just a day, YG Entertainment will be launching its first new girl group in seven years, BLACKPINK.\r\n\r\nIn the morning of August 7, YG posted a poster showing the countdown to BLACKPINK\u2019s debut on its official blog (www.yg-life.com\u00a0).

Every time the members were unveiled, they created sensation on-line, taking No.1 on the real-time search word ranking of search engines. Plus, the team\u2019s dance practice video surpassed 6.14 million views within a month of release.\r\n\r\nBLACKPINK\u2019s outstanding beauty and talent in dancing have already been fully recognized. Now, BLACKPINK is to present their own style of music and prove their talent in singing.\r\n\r\nYG\u2019s main producer TEDDY has worked on BLACKPINK\u2019s debut album for two years. \u201cBOOMBAYAH\u201d, one of the double title tracks of the album, is a song of a quick and intense rhythm, which will cool down this summer\u2019s heat wave. \u201cWHISTLE\u201d is a song about whispers of love and it is a minimal hip-hop song of a dreamlike and sexy feel.\r\n\r\nThen, what would be the biggest charms that will make you fall in love with BLACKPINK, the most promising rookie idol group for the second half of 2016? Here are the profiles of the four members of BLACKPINK for all the people who will soon become the girls\u2019 fans.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u25b6 \u201cSoul vocal\u201d JENNIE\r\n\r\nBorn in 1996, 20-years-old\r\n\r\nTrained for six years\r\n\r\nFrom Korea\r\n\r\nJENNIE is the first member of BLACKPINK unveiled by YG. She is the most well-known one among the members of the team. When YG hinted on the debut of a new girl group, JENNIE was thought to be the most powerful candidate for the group. JENNIE studied in New Zealand and she is known to be fluent in Korean, Japanese, and English.\r\n\r\nJENNIE gained recognition by taking part in G-DRAGON\u2019s solo album twice. She left a big impression by acting as G-DRAGON\u2019s girlfriend in the music video of \u201cThat XX\u201d released in 2012. She also featured for \u201cBLACK\u201d, the title track of G-DRAGON\u2019s second full-length album released in 2013 and performed for the song along with G-DRAGON on his comeback stage. By presenting soulful vocal and stable performance on the stage, she proved her potential.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u25b6 \u201cDance machine\u201d LISA\r\n\r\nBorn in 1997, 19-years-old\r\n\r\nTrained for 5 years\r\n\r\nFrom Thailand\r\n\r\nLISA was the second to be unveiled as a member of BLACKPINK. She is from Thailand and her beautiful legs, well-proportioned body, and exotic visual are drawing keen interest from music fans. Notably, as she is an outstanding dancer recognized by YG\u2019s head YANG HYUN SUK, she is drawing all the more attention. She already boasted her remarkably dynamic and fancy dance in \u201cWHO\u2019S THAT GIRL?\u201d video released in 2012 when she was a trainee of YG.\r\n\r\nPlus, LISA is fluent in not only Thai but also Korean, English, and Japanese. LISA acted in the music video of TAEYANG\u2019s \u201cRINGA LINGA\u201d in 2013. She also worked as the model for YG\u2019s global young-street casual fashion brand \u201cNONAGON\u201d along with iKON\u2019s B.I and BOBBY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u25b6 JISOO, \u201cthe next Tang Wei\u201d\r\n\r\nBorn in 1995, 21-years-old\r\n\r\nTrained for 4 years\r\n\r\nFrom Korea\r\n\r\nJISOO is considered the next-generation blue chip for advertisements. Fans call her \u201cthe next Tang Wei\u201d. She is also known as a versatile entertainer who is talented in dancing, singing, and acting.\r\n\r\nJISOO boasted her innocent and cute visual in the music videos of \u201cSPOILER\u201d of EPIK HIGH\u2019s 8th\u00a0full album and HI X SUHYUN\u2019s single \u201cI\u2019m Different\u201d released in 2014. JISOO acted a beautiful woman in love and shed tears, sensing breakup, in those music videos. In May, 2015, she gained recognition by appearing in KBS 2TV\u2019s drama series \u201cProducers\u201d as a cameo actor. Also, she has worked as the model for many ads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u25b6 \u201cNew face\u201d ROS\u00c9\r\n\r\nBorn in 1997, 19-years-old\r\n\r\nTrained for 4 years\r\n\r\nFrom Australia\r\n\r\nUnlike the other members of BLACKPINK, ROS\u00c9 is a new face who has never been officially unveiled to the media.

The music videos of BLACKPINK\u2019s debut singles\u2014\u201cBOOMBAYA\u201d and \u201cWHISTLE\u201d\u2014were released for the first time, and YANG HYUN SUK came to the showcase to talk about the meaning of YG\u2019s new girl group.\r\n\r\nHe started off by saying, \u201cI don\u2019t have much chance to meet reporters except for when I do \u2018K Pop Star\u2019. It never really got me nervous, but I was nervous before I got up on the stage today. For BLACKPINK members, today is like a birthday. I thought they might be very nervous, so I came to sit by them and show them my support.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe went on to say, \u201cI think it was four years ago when I first said I would release a new girl group. The biggest complaint we receive from fans is that YG artists release so few new songs or new albums. \u201c\r\n\r\n\u201cI really try to find ways to make the fans happy. I understand that fans want to see the singers that they like as much as they can, and that\u2019s why we work hard every day. YG\u2019s system is that singers and the staff have to be satisfied with the music that was made before releasing it to the public. Compared with 20 years ago, YG has become larger and has more producers. But we never got great results when we put a time limit on creating contents.\u201d\r\n\r\nYANG HYUN SUK also said, \u201cIn the end, if YG releases music that the singers and the staff are satisfied with, fans are satisfied with it too. I want our music to be perfect, even if fans resent me for so much time. In that sense, I would like to apologize for taking so much time to debut BLACKPINK. Now that they will debut today, I\u2019ll make sure the fans will get to see them a lot.\u201d\r\n\r\nJISOO said, \u201cOur debut got delayed, but we were happy to wait because we thought it would be best to debut after we\u2019re ready.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most number of questions that YANG HYUN SUK and members received were about BLACKPINK and 2NE1. YANG HYUN SUK said, \u201cI didn\u2019t really try to create something different. This was also the case when I made 2NE1. YG has its unique style. I think that the way to make the best girl group is to make one that is most YG-style. I didn\u2019t really try to create another 2NE1 either. Just as the same jacket look different on another person, BLACKPINK members have different faces and voices from those of 2NE1 members. So, I thought to myself \u2018Why not make the most YG-style girl group\u2019. I tried to come up with the best.\u201d\u00a0\r\n\r\nJISOO said, \u201cWe\u2019ve been compared to 2NE1 a lot because we\u2019re on the same label. But, they are seniors to us, and we want to be like them. We shouldn\u2019t be compared, BLACKPINK just need to follow in the footsteps of 2NE1.\u201d JENNIE commented, \u201cWe\u2019ve been living together for several years, and we\u2019re together 24\/7. We really know each other well, and we\u2019ve been practicing dancing and singing together for a long time. We\u2019ve got a lot to show.\u201d\r\n\r\nYANG HYUN SUK had a lot of affection for BLACKPINK. He said, \u201cI want to put them on the stage quickly. If they go on the stage, there won\u2019t be any need for further explanations. I\u2019m notorious for not giving praises. I never praised BLACKPINK, so I\u2019m quite nervous about whether they will be able to do well on the stage. But, I saw them practice and I\u2019m sure that they will do well. As time goes by, in just a month or a year or so, the public will be able to see that BLACKPINK is different from 2NE1.\u201d\r\n\r\nDuring the showcase, the music videos of \u201cBOOMBAYA\u201d and \u201cWHISTLE\u201d were released to the public for the first time. The \u201cWHISTLE\u201d music video was played first, and it is a song that is hypnotizing and dreamy-like. The 808 beat really stands out in the song as well as the rather unusual combination of rap and vocal. It shows the different appeals of each of the four members, and the music video is sensual yet sophisticated.\r\n\r\nThe music video of \u201cBOOMBAYA\u201d was played afterwards. It is a song with a unique and catchy rhythm. The drum beat is strong, and it has a bit more public appeal than \u201cWHISTLE\u201d. Members look charismatic and confident in the music video.\r\n\r\nBLACKPINK became an issue not only because they\u2019re on YG but also because of their pretty looks. The group is a rookie that has both the looks and the talent. About this, YANG HYUN SUK commented, \u201cYG has always tried to reverse the trend. But, with BLACKPINK, I wanted to reverse YG\u2019s trend. I wanted to go in a direction that we\u2019ve never tried before. Looks are in fact quite important.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe went on to say, \u201cI\u2019ve always thought of talent as the no.1 priority and looks are just something extra. But because we\u2019ve done this for the past 20 years, I started to think that I wanted to make a girl group that is talented and pretty a few years ago. In the case of BLACKPINK, they are not just pretty. Of course, it\u2019s hard to find a whole package. There are few who can sing, dance and are gorgeous at the same time. I had this in mind from the get go, and so it took time.\u00a0 It was different when I made 2NE1 or BIG MAMA. I just wanted to do something that I haven\u2019t done before. But, I don\u2019t want their music too be cute and pretty as well. I want them to be a team that does YG-style music but pretty.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen asked why BLACKPINK is a four-member group just like 2NE1, YANG HYUN SUK answered,\u201dAmong the candidates, these four were the most closest. I think this is the most important thing. The members have to get along. These four have been doing the monthly assessment together for a long time. Watching them, I thought they would make a good team together. There were other candidates, but I didn\u2019t want to go out of my way to make a five-member or a six-member group.\u201d\r\n\r\nAbout the direction of BLACKPINK\u2019s promotions, YANG HYUN SUK said, \u201cTheir album has already been completed. We\u2019ve been preparing for their album for more than two years, and we\u2019ve finished making eight tracks. We already have a music video all set and done for another song. But the public needs time to get to know BLACKPINK. To be honest, I haven\u2019t decided yet on whether to release their album or just release two singles next. I just want to put them on the stage quickly.\u201d\r\n\r\nJISOO said, \u201cPeople have been saying that we\u2019re YG\u2019s first new girl group in seven years, and it has been a burden on us. But we practiced really hard and will try to put on a perfect stage. We\u2019ll practice doing lives and dancing so that we don\u2019t ruin YG\u2019s reputation.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLastly, YANG HYUN SUK said, \u201cBecause we don\u2019t make many girl groups, it is a great burden. 2NE1 is on a short break right now, and BLACKPINK debut timing makes them a representative of YG artists. And I think they are very aware of that. I really do hope BLACKPINK will do well. I\u2019ll do everything in my power to help them. I feel like I\u2019m sending off my kids to school on their first day of elementary school. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll adjust quickly and do better as time goes by. I hope you have faith in them too and send them your support.\u201d\u00a0\r\n\r\nBLACKPINK is not a group that is hard to differentiate from 2NE1 as their music and their style is what suits them the most. YANG HYUN SUK repeated several times that he want to put them on the stage quickly, and if they are all what he say they are, it will be exciting to see the youngest YG group BLACKPINK grow.\r\n\r\n2016. 8. 8.","post_date":"2016-08-30","related_blog":[],"main_image":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/htm_2016081581047602342_99_20160815081203.jpg","thumb_2x1":false,"thumb_3x2":false},"945":{"id":945,"post_title":"[At the Scene] YG\u2019s Signature Girl Group is About to be Born","url_friendly_name":"at-the-scene-ygs-signature-girl-group-is-about-to-be-born","excerpt":"","post_content":"\r\n\r\n[\uc77c\uac04\uc2a4\ud3ec\uce20=\ud669\ubbf8\ud604 \uae30\uc790]\u00a0YG\u2019s jewel box has been opened. It took a long time for YG to form a group whose members have the looks and the talent to make it to the top, but the group is now ready to take its first step.\r\n\r\nAt 3 PM on August 8, BLACKPINK\u2019s debut showcase was held at a studio in Sinsa-dong. The members, who have trained at YG for four to six years, said, \u201cWe\u2019re so nervous. We\u2019ve waited for this for a long time, and we will do our best. Please send us your support.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was the first time that JISOO, JENNIE, LISA, and ROS\u00c9 stood before the public, and they answered the questions with trembling voices but with smiles. When they were asked about 2NE1, they seemed to be put in a difficult position, but they were confident enough to say, \u201cWe admire them. But, we have set the color of our team first.\u201d\r\n\r\nFour years have passed since YG announced that they will launch a new girl group. It took quite a long time for BLACKPINK to debut, and members commented, \u201cWe were not worried. We were happy to wait because the most important thing is to be well prepared for the debut.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nYANG HYUN SUK stood beside BLACKPINK members at the showcase and said, \u201cI said I debut them years ago. I think it was four years ago. The biggest complaint we receive from fans is that YG artists release so few new songs or new albums. Compared with before, YG has grown greatly. Creating contents is not something that you can put a time limit on. I want to make the fans happy, but it\u2019s more important that YG releases contents that are at a satisfactory level. Making great music is of utmost priority for me even if people resent me for it.\u201d\r\n\r\nBLACKPINK members have the talent and the looks. This is unusual for YG, a label that used to focus on talent over looks. Regarding this, YANG HYUN SUK commented, \u201cI wanted to try a different direction with BLACKPINK. Of course, looks are important, especially because they are stars and entertainers. I do think that being pretty is a good thing. But, this was never a priority for me as seen in the cases of BIG MAMA and 2NE1. This also goes for BIGBANG too. In the beginning, BIGBANG was criticized for their looks.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nHe went on to say, \u201cWe\u2019ve been working under the same system for 20 years, and I thought that this time I want to make a group with the looks as well as the talent. It took such a long time because I wanted all the members to be pretty and talented.\u201d\r\n\r\nBLACKPINK\u2019s new singles\u2014\u201cBOOMBAYA\u201d and \u201cWHISTLE\u201d\u2014will be released at 8 PM on August 8. The group consists of JISOO, JENNIE, LISA, and ROS\u00c9, going against the trend of large groups. It shows that BLACKPINK members are the selected few who have enough charisma to jump into the game.\r\n\r\nBLACKPINK has lot of cards under the sleeve. First, all the members have gone through rigorous training at YG for as short as four years to as long as six years. Since BLACKPINK is YG\u2019s first new girl group after 2NE1, it has been receiving full support from the label. YG\u2019s main producer TEDDY was put in charge of producing BLACKPINK\u2019s debut album, and the title song has been written and made by TEDDY.\r\n\r\nIn addition, four renowned choreographers from outside of Korea made the choreography for BLACKPINK. This was YANG HYUN SUK\u2019s idea. Earlier on, BLACKPINK\u2019s dance practice video was released, and it posted more than six million views in just a month after its release. This demonstrates the phenomenal amount of attention a group that hasn\u2019t even debut yet has been getting.\r\n\r\n\u201cBOOMBAYA\u201d is a fast-tempo song with a beat exciting enough to chase the heat away, and \u201cWHISTLE\u201d is a sexy, hypnotizing hip-hop song with a simple beat about whispers of love.\r\n\r\n2016. 8. 8.\r\n\r\n\r\n","post_date":"2016-08-30","related_blog":[],"main_image":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/20160808173724563468_99_20160808180405.jpg","thumb_2x1":false,"thumb_3x2":false},"944":{"id":944,"post_title":"YANG HYUN SUK Says, \u201cBLACKPINK doesn\u2019t have a leader, the first among YG artists.\u201d","url_friendly_name":"yang-hyun-suk-says-blackpink-doesnt-have-a-leader-the-first-among-yg-artists","excerpt":"","post_content":"\r\n[\uc5d1\uc2a4\ud3ec\uce20\ub274\uc2a4=\uc804\uc544\ub78c \uae30\uc790]\u00a0YG\u2019s leader YANG HYUN SUK announced that BLACKPINK does not have a leader.\r\n\r\nOn August 8, the showcase of BLACKPINK\u2019s debut single album \u201cSQUARE ONE\u201d was held at a studio in Sinsa-dong.

It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t care about WINNER or iKON. I did put a lot of effort into them too behind the stage when they were doing the survival shows.

So, I\u2019m a bit anxious.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe went on to say, \u201cIt is as five times as hard to make a girl group than a boy group. There are lots of things to take care of and to reinforce. I\u2019ve been watching BLACKPINK members train for six years, and I believe they are up to the task.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBLACKPINK doesn\u2019t have a leader.

It is a group that YG Entertainment, one of the three biggest entertainment companies in Korea, launched for the first time in seven years after 2NE1. The group\u2019s debut showcase was held at 3 PM on August 8 at a studio in Sinsa-dong, Seoul.\r\n\r\nThe music videos of \u201cWHISTLE\u201d and \u201cBOOMBAYA\u201d, the tracks of BLACKPINK\u2019s debut single album \u201dSQUARE ONE\u201d, were released for the first time at the showcase. YANG HYUN SUK attended to show his support for the group as they embark on their great journey.\r\n\r\n\u25c7 Tell us about BLACKPINK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJENNIE, JISOO, LISA, ROS\u00c9, who all have been YG trainees from four to six years, are members of BLACKPINK. The name means that the group has talent and the looks.\u00a0\r\n\r\nJISOO\u2019s face is already known to the public as she featured on the music videos of EPIK HIGH and HI&amp;SOO HYUN. Thanks to her beauty, she appeared on a number of ads and shows great talent in dancing, singing and acting. JENNIE featured on G-DRAGON\u2019s \u201cBLACK\u201d, the title track of his second solo album, and showed off her powerful and soulful voice. She studied in New Zealand when she was younger, and she is fluent in English and Japanese.\r\n\r\nROS\u00c9 joined YG as a trainee four years ago when she was 15. She also featured on G-DRAGON\u2019s \u201cWITHOUT YOU\u201d and is the main vocalist of BLACKPINK. LISA is from Thailand, and she has been a trainee of YG for five years. She is great in dancing and has been dancing as part of dance crews since she was a child.\r\n\r\nYANG HYUN SUK said, \u201cI experimented a lot. There were dozens of candidates. Some are still trainees and some have left YG. I think the four we have now is the best combination.\u201d\r\n\r\nBLACKPINK said, \u201cWe\u2019re nervous because we\u2019ve been waiting for this for a long time. We\u2019ve been trained for a long time and we\u2019ll do our best to show you a great performance.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u25c7 How is BLACKPINK different from 2NE1?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYANG HYUN SUK answered, \u201cI just want to say that I didn\u2019t go out of my way to make them different from 2NE1. My thought was that making the most YG-like group is the most important thing.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe added, \u201cUntil now, I valued \u2018cool\u2019 over \u2018good-looking\u2019 or \u2018pretty\u2019. Looks weren\u2019t my priority when I made BIG MAMA, 2NE1, or BIGBANG. This was how I did things for the past 20 years, but I wanted to try a different way this time. I wanted BLACKPINK to be a group that has the looks and the talent.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to find people who can sing, dance and are pretty at the same time. That\u2019s why it took so long,\u201d he said with a chuckle.\r\n\r\nJISOO said, \u201cPeople compare us with 2NE1 a lot, but they are seniors to us. We just want to be like them and follow in their footsteps.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u25c7 Will BLACKPINK be the next leading artist of YG?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACKPINK\u2019s debut album \u201cSQUARE ONE\u201d will be released later in the day at 8 PM. YG\u2019s main producer TEDDY has been working on the album for more than two years.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe album consists of two tracks: a hip-hop song titled \u201cWHISTLE\u201d which is about the desire to receive confirmation of love and a fast EDM song titled \u201cBOOMBAYA\u201d, a song about loving yourself.\r\n\r\nYANG HYUN SUK said, \u201cWe\u2019ve completed eight tracks. We\u2019re releasing two music videos today, but we\u2019ve have completed making another one. I think we\u2019ll have to see on whether to release the album straight away or release two singles next like this time.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs the showcase was nearing to an end, YANG HYUN SUK showed his confidence in the new girl group by saying, \u201cI feel nervous as if I\u2019m sending off my kids to school on their first day of elementary school, but I want to put them on the stage quickly.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe added, \u201cI feel worried and burdened because we haven\u2019t launched many girl groups before. As you all know, 2NE1 has been on a break for two years now, and since BLACKPINK is filling in the gap as the next YG girl group, we\u2019re feeling a lot of pressure. I hope BLACKPINK will do well, and I\u2019ll do everything to help them.\u201d\r\n\r\nJISOO commented, \u201cSince we\u2019re YG\u2019s first girl group in seven years, we feel a lot has been put on our shoulders. But we will continue to practice hard so that we put on a perfect stage and don\u2019t ruin YG\u2019s reputation.\u201d\r\n\r\n2016. 8. 8.","post_date":"2016-08-30","related_blog":[],"main_image":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/20160808173724563468_99_20160808180405.jpg","thumb_2x1":false,"thumb_3x2":false},"936":{"id":936,"post_title":"BLACKPINK rising as the blue chip in the advertisement scene upon their debut","url_friendly_name":"blackpink-rising-as-the-blue-chip-in-the-advertisement-scene-upon-their-debut","excerpt":"","post_content":"\r\n\r\n[OSEN=\ucd5c\ub098\uc601 \uae30\uc790]\u00a0Rookie girl group BLACKPINK has been selected as the new model for cosmetics brand moonshot, drawing keen attention in the advertisement world.\r\n\r\nBLACKPINK will work as the new muse of cosmetics brand moonshot under YG Entertainment\u2019s subsidiary YG PLUS, to promote a variety of products of the brand.\r\n\r\nBLACKPINK\u2019s members who are 19-years-old on average boast healthy and clear skin, so industry insiders say that they are perfect models for a cosmetics brand.\r\n\r\nSo far, BIGBANG\u2019s G-DRAGON and 2NE1\u2019s DARA have promoted moonshot brand.

Because they have been making preparations for such a long time, the group is dubbed as YG\u2019s \u201cjewel box\u201d. Now that BLACKPINK has debuted, fans are able to see they have the looks and the talent as YG guaranteed.\r\n\r\nBLACKPINK debuted by releasing \u201cBOOMBAYA\u201d and \u201cWHISTLE\u201d, the title tracks of their debut single album \u201cSQUARE ONE\u201d, at 8 PM on August 8. They have received much spotlight as they are YG\u2019s first new girl group in seven years. YG\u2019s YANG HYUN SUK said that he would launch a new girl group four years ago, but the launch had been delayed much to fans\u2019 disappointment. At a showcase on August 8, he said, \u201cI know what the fans want, but their debut has been delayed several times. I believed that it is better to present to the fans with something that is more satisfactory. I want to put BLACKPINK on the stage quickly. I\u2019m sure that they are up to the task.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u25b6 BLACKPINK members background\r\n\r\nHe had every reason to be confident. The members of BLACKPINK, ROS\u00c9, JENNIE, LISA, and JISOO, have been trained at YG for four to six years. They have been assessed by YANG HYUN SUK himself monthly and honed their skills.\r\n\r\nJENNIE (20) was the first to be announced. She studied in New Zealand for a while and is fluent in Korean, Japanese, and English. She made herself known to the public by appearing in the music video of G-DRAGON\u2019s \u201cTHAT XX\u201d. In 2013, she featured on the title track of \u201cBLACK\u201d, the title track of G-DRAGON\u2019s second solo album. Her excellent rap makes her stand out in BLACKPINK\u2019s debut songs.\r\n\r\nLISA (19) is the only foreigner artist in YG. She is from Thailand, and she is great in dancing. LISA\u2019s \u201cWho\u2019s That Girl\u201d dance video released in 2012 became quite an issue. Just like JENNIE, LISA is also fluent in Korean, Japanese, and English on top of her mother tongue. She appeared in the music video of TAEYANG\u2019s \u201cRINGA RINGA\u201d and was YG\u2019s NONAGON model along with iKON\u2019s B.I and BOBBY.\r\n\r\nJISOO (21) is the oldest of BLACKPINK members. She appeared in the music videos of EPIK HIGH\u2019s\u201dSPOILER&amp;HAPPEN ENDING\u201d and HI&amp;SOOHYUN\u2019s \u201cI\u2019M DIFFERENT\u201d. In 2015, she appeared as a cameo in KBS 2\u2019 drama series \u201cProducer\u201d.\r\n\r\nROS\u00c9 (19) has been a trainee at YG since 2012 after winning its audition contest first place. She featured on G-DRAGON\u2019s \u201cWITHOUT YOU\u201d, a track in his mini-album \u201cONE OF A KIND\u201d, and is known to play the guitar well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u25b6BLACKPINK sets new records in just a day\r\n\r\nBLACKPINK has set new records in just a day after their debut. After its release at 8 PM on August 8, BLACKPINK\u2019s \u201cWHISTLE\u201d topped four charts in just an hour and all the charts in just four hours. \u201cBOOMBAYA\u201d is also popular ranking fifth on the charts.\r\n\r\nBLACKPINK\u2019s popularity is going global. As of August 9, their new single album \u201cSQUARE ONE\u201d topped the charts in just 12 hours after release in 12 countries including Hong Kong, Finland, Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Norway, Paraguay, the Philippines, Singapore, Turkey, and Vietnam. It also ranked second in the US and 11th\u00a0in the UK, which is unusual for a rookie.\r\n\r\nBLACKPINK\u2019s music video views are also going up rapidly. The music videos of \u201cBOOMBAYA\u201d and \u201cWHISTLE\u201d surpassed seven million views in total in just five hours after release on Naver\u2019s TV Cast and on Youtube.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u25b6A group with both the looks and talent, which is a rare case in YG\r\n\r\nBLACKPINK is YG\u2019s new experiment, but at the same time, it is the most YG-like group. Just like 2NE1, BLACKPINK consists of four members. When asked about the style of BLACKPINK\u2019s music, YANG HYUN SUK answered, \u201cI didn\u2019t try to force them to be different from 2NE1. YG has its own style. No matter the group, we try to make music that is most YG-like. The same jacket looks different when different people put it on, and so BLACKPINK will just be doing YG-style music.\u201d\r\n\r\nOut of all YG groups, BLACKPINK is said to have the most gorgeous looks. It is a new experiment considering that YG focused more on talent than looks when it launched 2NE1, BIGBANG, and BIG MAMA. YANG HYUN SUK commented, \u201cIt is indeed a new direction. Looks are important because they are stars and entertainers. But I do believe being pretty is good. It wasn\u2019t my no.1 priority when I made BIG MAMA or 2NE1. It was the same for BIGBANG. At first, BIGBANG was also criticized for their looks. This was how I did things for the past 20 years, so I wanted to go a different direction when I made BLACKPINK. I wanted a group that has the looks and the talent, so that\u2019s why it took such a long time.\u201d\r\n\r\n2016. 8. 10.\r\n\r\n","post_date":"2016-08-30","related_blog":[],"main_image":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/htm_2016081581047602342_99_20160815081203.jpg","thumb_2x1":false,"thumb_3x2":false},"923":{"id":923,"post_title":"[Exclusive] SONG MINHO X BOBBY did guerilla shooting of music video in Itaewon\u2026 Soon to be launched","url_friendly_name":"exclusive-song-minho-x-bobby-did-guerilla-shooting-of-music-video-in-itaewon-soon-to-be-launched","excerpt":"","post_content":"\r\n\r\n[OSEN=\uc815\uc900\ud654 \uae30\uc790]\u00a0The new combination that is drawing keen attention!

YG\u2019s artists are drawing even bigger attention overseas than in Korea.\r\n\r\nBLACKPINK, a rookie girl group that YG ambitiously launched for the first time in seven years, dominated music charts in Korea, entered top 10 on iTunes charts, and topped iTunes chart of nine countries, upon their debut on August 8. Riding on such momentum, BLACKPINK set an unprecedented record of becoming the first Korean girl group to top the iTunes worldwide chart of the United States, on August 10.\r\n\r\nThe reason why BLACKPINK could become such a \u201cmonstrous rookie\u201d who is recognized not only in Korea but also overseas upon their debut is attributable to YG\u2019s outstanding capabilities of creating good contents. YG\u2019s CEO YANG HYUN SUK has a firm principle of creating best contents on the basis of YG\u2019s unique musical style. Such principle was the very foundation for creation of BLACKPINK.\r\n\r\nThe principle is now getting recognized globally. Foreign pop music fans are showing keen interest in BLACKPINK who has outstanding beauty, talent in singing, and capabilities as professional artists. The music videos of BLACKPINK\u2019s \u201cWHISTLE\u201d and \u201cBOOMBAYAH\u201d surpassed 1.73 million views and 1.37 million views, respectively, on NAVER TV CAST as of August 11 at 8AM.\r\n\r\nOn YouTube which best-demonstrates an artist\u2019s global popularity, the music videos of the two songs are recording 6.3 million and over-7 million views, surpassing 10 million views in combination within three days of BLACKPINK\u2019s debut.

Let us take you to behind the scenes of the \u201cWHISTLE\u201d music video.\r\nAs \u201cWHISTLE\u201d is the first song that BLACKPINK ever recorded and the first music video the group ever filmed, it bears great significance to the members.\r\nThe \u201cWHISTLE\u201d music video\u2019s unique and sensual scenes are quite an eye-catcher. Naver\u2019s Entertainment Special will take you behind the scenes of BLACKPINK\u2019s first music video shoot. Let\u2019s go!\r\n\r\n\r\nA lot of mystical computer graphic effects have been used in the \u201cWHISTLE\u201d music video.\r\n\r\nTo shoot the scene where they go up gracefully, ROS\u00c9 and JISOO had to be attached to wires. ROS\u00c9 was the first to go. She was not afraid and did what she had to do without showing any signs of discomfort. After shooting the scene, she shouted out loud, \u201cI feel so happy!\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThen, it was JISOO\u2019s turn. Before shooting the scene, she seemed to be worried because she\u2019s scared of heights. But when the shooting began, she did the scene perfectly. Let\u2019s give a big hand to JISOO for being so brave!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJENNIE had to shoot a scene with her on a horse. She went up on the horse on her first try and surprised the staff. The truth is she learned how to ride a horse when she was a child. and she had been looking forward to shooting the scene.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is LISA shooting her part in the music video. Isn\u2019t she lovely fiddling about with the game controller? She looks cute now, but when the shooting begins, she switches her mode and becomes charismatic.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThis is LISA monitoring after shooting her part. It was hard to believe that it was her first time shooting a music video, and thorough monitoring must be the secret!\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis is BLACKPINK under a chandelier. This scene was also used in the poster. Although, they were not wearing heels, their legs look fabulously long!\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJISOO\u2019s face looks perfect from either side. The staff could not take their eyes off the monitoring screen while shooting this scene.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhen JENNIE was shooting this scene, suddenly it started to rain. But, the shooting had to go on and everyone had become wet. After the shoot was done, they were glad that scene turned out so great and that they didn\u2019t get wet for nothing. \u00a0\r\n\r\nThe shooting continued all through the night, and ROS\u00c9 went around cheering and thanking everyone by saying, \u201cSorry that you have to stay up all night for this and thank you.\u201d The shooting went on for hours, but she didn\u2019t frown for one second and worked hard all the way through. It was really thoughtful of her to thank the staff too.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s that green ball that LISA is sitting on? CG effects were used to make the green ball look like the earth in the music video. The scene in the music video in which members sit on the earth is quite impressive, and this is how they shot the scene.\r\n\r\nThis is how they shot the scene with all the members in a car. The car kept going round and round, so some members got car sick!

It was hard to believe that they are rookies after seeing their flawless singing and dancing.\r\n\r\nThe \u201cBOOMBAYAH\u201d performance was enough to make anyone fall in love with BLACKPINK. They put on a fierce stage and danced to the powerful beat without making a single mistake. It was difficult to take your eyes off the members as they sang and danced to the song perfectly. The audience sang along, reflecting BLACKPINK\u2019s huge popularity.\r\n\r\nJENNIE sprained her ankle when the group was pre-recording the show on August 12. But she took painkillers and went up on the stage even though she was in great pain. Seeing her performance, it was hard to believe that she sprained her ankle only hours ago. Since JENNIE had been a trainee of YG for as much as six years, the debut stage was something that she dreamed about for a long time. It was touching to see her work so hard despite the pain for her dreams.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the same day, BLACKPINK regained the no.1 spot on the charts of Korea\u2019s seven major music streaming websites: Melon, Olleh Music, Naver Music, Mnet, Bugs, Soribada, and Genie.\r\n\r\nAlthough BLACKPINK is a mere rookie, their songs have been ranking high on the charts as if waiting for the right moment to take the no.1 spot. Just before their first debut stage, BLACKPINK took back the no.1 spot on the charts and proved they are a monster rookie.\r\n\r\nThe numbers also show that BLACKPINK is indeed a mega rookie. In just 100 hours after its release, the \u201cBOOMBAYAH\u201d music video surpassed 10 million views, and later in the day, \u201cWHISTLE\u201d music video also surpassed the 10 million mark. Combined, the two music videos posted more than 20 million views, reflecting the group\u2019s global popularity. \u201cWHISTLE\u201d is also no.1 on the charts of Korea\u2019s eight major music streaming websites.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, BLACKPINK is YG\u2019s first new girl group in seven years. The group consists of JISOO, JENNIE, ROS\u00c9, and LISA, who have been trainees at YG for as long as six years. On August 8, BLACKPINK released their debut single album \u201cSQUARE ONE\u201d, and the title tracks of the album, \u201cWHISTLE\u201d and \u201cBOOMBAYAH\u201d, are currently sweeping the charts.\r\n\r\n2016. 8. 14.\r\n\r\n","post_date":"2016-08-30","related_blog":[],"main_image":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/htm_20160814163645217492_99_20160814165303.jpg","thumb_2x1":false,"thumb_3x2":false},"904":{"id":904,"post_title":"After their Debut Stage, BLACKPINK said, \u201cOur minds went blank when we went up on the stage.

The group debuted in 2006 with a single album titled \u201cBIGBANG\u201d. Since then, it has become an iconic boy group representing K-Pop and Korea\u2019s mass culture. BIGBANG has set, and is still setting, a number of new records and opened up a new chapter in the history of K-Pop. BIGBANG is not just an idol group but artists. Let\u2019s see BIGBANG through numbers.\r\n\r\n\u25c7100=According to Billboards, BIGBANG held a total of 100 concerts abroad from 2013 to 2016, the biggest number among K-Pop artists. A total of 1,456 K-Pop concerts were held abroad during the same period. The tickets to BIGBANG\u2019s concerts were all sold out, demonstrating BIGBANG\u2019s ticket power. During their first world tour, \u201cALIVE TOUR\u201d, BIGBANG held concerts in 12 countries and drew 800,000 people. In their \u201cMADE\u201d tour, which started in 2015 and ended in March this year, BIGBANG held 66 concerts in 13 countries and drew 1.5 million people as audience. If you look by countries, BIGBANG held 18 concerts in four cities in Japan and drew 911,000 people as audience, and in China, drew 250,000 people by holding concerts in 13 cities.\r\n\r\n\u25c710 million= BIGBANG\u2019s leader, G-DRAGON, is the first Asian celebrity to have surpassed the 10 million mark in the number of SNS followers. This shows that G-DRAGON is indeed the hottest star in Asia. G-DRAGON not only makes and writes songs for BIGBANG but also receives much spotlight for his unique and trendy fashion style. Thanks to his great fashion sense, he has recently been chosen as the model of 8 Seconds and is participating in designing too. Last year, together with Kwon Oh-sang, G-DRAGON held a contemporary arts exhibition titled \u201cPEACEMINUSONE: Beyond the Stage\u201d.\r\n\r\n\u25c7242 million= The music video of BIGBANG\u2019s \u201cFANTASITC BABY\u201d posted 242,168,000 views on Youtube. This is the first time that a Korean artist\u2019s music video surpassed the two hundred million mark. In addition, four of BIGBANG\u2019s music videos surpassed the one hundred million mark, the first among K-Pop groups.\r\n\r\n\u25c750.6 billion= According to Forbes, BIGBANG ranked 54th\u00a0among its list of 100 top-earning celebrities. From June 2015, BIGBANG earned a whopping 50.6 billion won (44 million dollars), which is more than what Maroon 5 earned, which stands at 33.5 million dollars. It is the first time that a Korean artist was included in the list. Thanks to BIGBANG\u2019s success, YG Entertainment\u2019s sales grew 10-fold compared with 2008 and reached 193 billion won.\r\n\r\nWhat will the future be like for BIGBANG, a group that has set countless numbers of new records? At a press conference held earlier this month, G-DRAGON said, \u201cWe think a lot about our next step and about our next ten years. If we can inspire people, we want to contribute to enhancing the culture, and right now, we\u2019re trying to draw the big picture for that.\u201d\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, to celebrate BIGBANG\u2019s 10th\u00a0anniversary, a number of events are taking place.

YG explains that \u201cLIFTED\u201d means an \u201cexcited and upbeat feeling\u201d in this song.\r\n\r\nThen, why does it have to be America and why does it have to be CL?\r\n\r\nYou can find the answer in SBS \u201cHealing Camp\u201d show aired on May 21, 2012.\r\n\r\nIn the show, YG\u2019s CEO YANG HYUN SUK said that he wanted to go beyond and play a bigger game on the global stage. \u201cGlobal\u201d mostly meant America and Europe where there are big and matured pop music markets. In the past, YANG tried to expand to the American pop market with SEVEN, but he experienced failure at that time.\r\n\r\nYANG said in \u201cHealing Camp\u201d, \u201cFor SEVEN, I couldn\u2019t do much and even I myself was not sure about whether the project really began in earnest or not. What SEVEN did most in the States was English lessons. He released one single and we even did not do any promotion. I didn\u2019t know how to do it\u201d.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn my opinion, in American and European music markets, women have bigger possibility of success than men. There is a huge gap between the appeals of Asian men when seen by Western women and appeals of Asian women seen by Western men\u201d, added YANG.\r\n\r\nIn short, \u201ca female artist who is fluent in English\u201d is the best option for YG\u2019s penetration in the States. If such female artist has outstanding talent that could appeal in the country, that is the right one customized for YANG HYUN SUK\u2019s project for YG\u2019s business in the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCL is a woman who had lived overseas when she was young, so fluent in English. Plus, she has an outstanding talent in music. The potential of her success in American pop music market has already been confirmed.\r\n\r\nFor almost two years, CL has established strategies for her debut in the States along with Scooter Braun. Scooter Braun is responsible for management of world-famous pop stars including Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande and he helped PSY\u2019s success in the States.\r\n\r\nCL released \u201cHELLO BITCHES\u201d, the pre-promotion song for her debut in America, in November last year, to take No.1 on global music-streaming website Sportify. Such record proved her \u201cpotential\u201d.\r\n\r\nNow, YG and YANG HYUN SUK\u2019s long-cherished dream has taken its first step for realization. YANG HYUN SUK has achieved remarkable success as the head producer of YG so far.

YG\u2019s new girl group has been drawing keen attention since the company\u2019s announcement in May that a new girl group would be launched soon. The rookie YG girl group that had yet to make debut drew keen interest from the public, for the number of the members and profile of each member.\r\n\r\nYG Entertainment unveiled debut teaser images of each member starting from JENNIE every week from June 1. Teaser images of LISA were unveiled on June 8, JISOO on June 15, and ROS\u00c9 on June 22. Then, on June 29, group photos of all BLACKPINK members were unveiled. Pre-promotion before official debut was perfect. Every time each member was unveiled, BLACKPINK created sensation. Because of such promotion, BLACKPINK built recognition during the whole month. BLACKPINK was originally supposed to debut in July, but they actually made debut in a debut showcase on August 8. The four members of BLACKPINK are 19 years old on average. They were hard-trained by YG for four to six years. After numerous speculations and predictions for the new girl gorup of YG for years, BLACKPINK has been finally born.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt BLACKPINK\u2019s debut showcase, YANG HYUN SUK said, \u201cA few years ago, I once said that I wanted to make a girl group whose members are pretty and talented at the same time. It took a long time for me to create BLACKPINK who perfectly suits the concept. Rather than focusing on differentiation from other girl groups including 2NE1, I tried to create a team that has its own unique style that best-expresses YG\u2019s color\u201d.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhen BLACKPINK\u2019s debut song was unveiled after the showcase at 8PM on the same day, it took No.1 on four music-streaming websites. The music video released on the same day surpassed three million views within three hours of release.\r\n\r\nBLACKPINK is showing substantial influence even on Billboard chart.\r\n\r\nAmerican Billboard extolled BLACKPINK on the 16 this month (local time), saying, \u201cBlackpink is less than a month old, but the new girl group is already making major moves on the Billboard charts with their debut\u2026 Blackpink is only the seventh K-pop act to hit No. 1 on World Digital Songs. The group now joins the company of PSY (who has four No. 1s on the chart), BIGBANG (with three) plus 2NE1, EXO, CL, BTS, plus G-Dragon and Taeyang (all with one). Nevertheless, Blackpink is the fastest\u00a0act to hit No. 1\u00a0on the chart, and only\u00a0the third to hold the top two\u00a0positions after PSY and BIGBANG.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBOOMBAYAH\u201d and \u201cWHISTLE\u201d, the double title tracks of BLACKPINK\u2019s debut single album \u201cSQUARE ONE\u201d, took No.1 and No.2 on American Billboard\u2019s World Digital Songs chart, respectively. \u201cWHISTLE\u201d became the first K-pop song that topped American iTunes chart and worldwide chart at the same time within two days of release.\r\n\r\nThe music videos of the two songs surpassed 10 million views on YouTube within five days of release. On the 10th\u00a0day from release, on August 18, the video of \u201cWHISTLE\u201d is recording 13,790,000 views and \u201cBOOMBAYAH\u201d, 15,960,000 views.\r\n\r\n2016. 8. 18.","post_date":"2016-08-30","related_blog":[],"main_image":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/26217416_99_20160828100703.jpg","thumb_2x1":false,"thumb_3x2":false},"879":{"id":879,"post_title":"YG posted happy birthday image for G-DRAGON\u2026 Tomorrow is 10th anniversary of BIGBANG\u2019s debut","url_friendly_name":"yg-posted-happy-birthday-image-for-g-dragon-tomorrow-is-10th-anniversary-of-bigbangs-debut","excerpt":"","post_content":"\r\n\r\n[OSEN=\uc815\uc900\ud654 \uae30\uc790]\u00a0YG Entertainment (\u201cYG\u201d) unveiled a happy birthday image for G-DRAGON on August 18.\r\n\r\nThe image unveiled on August 18 at 0AM on YG\u2019s official blog (www.yg-life.com) shows G-DRAGON making a cute smiling facial expression with his two hands covering his face.

BIGBANG was launched with full potential and big expectations from music fans. For the past 10 years since then, BIGBANG has taken No.1 for every song they released, always staying at the center of interest and spotlight. Now, BIGBANG is an unmatched idol boy group that does not need any further explanation.\r\n\r\nBIGBANG is at the center of interest overseas as well. Foreign media outlets spotlight BIGBANG\u2019s new songs. BIGBANG holds tour concerts not only in Asia but also in America and Europe. In 2011, BIGBANG received \u201cMTV Europe Music Awards\u201d for the first time for a Korean artist. Last year, American New York Times extolled BIGBANG\u2019s concert, saying, \u201cBoy bands were created in the United States like automobiles, but they were completed in somewhere else\u201d.\r\n\r\nIt is only natural for BIGBANG to get such big congratulations for the 10th\u00a0anniversary of their debut. Most idol boy groups broke before their 7th\u00a0anniversary, failing to overcome the \u201c7th\u00a0year jinx\u201d. One or two members of many boy bands came to stand out than others and the gap between their careers grew bigger. In the process, some of those teams\u2019 members broke away from the teams, members changed, and some even tentatively retired. However, BIGBANG has survived through such environment. SHINHWA is the only idol boy group in Korea who has maintained the team for more than 10 years, other than BIGBANG. You can see how meaningful and great BIGBANG\u2019s 10th\u00a0anniversary is.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIGBANG had some crisis, too. Nevertheless, BIGBANG\u2019s teamwork grew even stronger in the process of overcoming them. In the 10th\u00a0anniversary exhibition \u201cBIGBANG10 THE EXHIBITION :A TO Z\u201d, T.O.P said, \u201cWe have never fought so far\u201d.\r\n\r\nG-DRAGON said, \u201cThere have been a lot of good things, as well as bad things. The most memorable time was when I was a trainee. Since BIGBANG\u2019s debut, we have been greatly loved, working in a very good environment. If it were not for those days of hard training, BIGBANG today would not have existed\u201d.\r\n\r\nTAEYANG explained, \u201cWe\u2019ve changed in a good way, filling each other\u2019s gaps and leading each other. We have grown older year after year, taking care of each other and maintaining good relationship\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe existence of 10-year-long boy group is a firm role model for junior boy groups. Such big expectations for BIGBANG may be burdensome for them, but BIGBANG is drawing a bigger picture.\r\n\r\nG-DRAGON said, \u201cThe biggest issue for us recently is what our next step will be. We\u2019ve been so much loved by many people, but at the same time, we\u2019ve gone through many things and overcome them. As we have been doing so far, we\u2019ll keep living with this tension. As more people recognize us and love us, we sometimes feel burdened. Just creating good music is not enough. We want to give good influence to young generations in and out of the country\u201d.\r\n\r\nSuch remarks are the proof of even more promising next 10 years for BIGBANG than their past 10 years.\r\n\r\n2016. 8. 19.\r\n\r\n","post_date":"2016-08-30","related_blog":[],"main_image":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/htm_2016081901332919437_99_20160819065106.jpg","thumb_2x1":false,"thumb_3x2":false},"870":{"id":870,"post_title":"[BIGBANG 10th Anniversary \u2460] From \u201creal documentary\u201d to \u201cMADE\u201d series\u2026 The history of BIGBANG\u2019s past 10 years","url_friendly_name":"bigbang-10th-anniversary-%e2%91%a0-from-real-documentary-to-made-series-the-history-of-bigbangs-past-10-years","excerpt":"","post_content":"[\ud5e4\ub7f4\ub4dcPOP=\ub178\uc724\uc815 \uae30\uc790]\u00a0Boys who fascinated audience on the stage have now become a brand, BIGBANG.

The five winners who managed to survive in the competition took their first step into the music scene in YG Family\u2019s 10th\u00a0anniversary concert held on August 19 in 2006 at Seoul Olympic Gymnastics Arena. \u00a0\r\n\r\nBIGBANG became famous upon their debut, with hit songs such as \u201cWe Belong Together\u201d and \u201cLa La La\u201d. From their very debut, BIGBANG members actively participated in production of their album, writing the melody and lyrics for their songs. That was how BIGBANG was different from \u201ccookie-cutter\u201d idol boy groups of other music labels. Indeed, \u201cWe Belong Together\u201ds melody and lyrics were written by G-DRAGON, with help from T.O.P for the lyrics. All the members wrote the lyrics of \u201cLa La La\u201d together.\r\n\r\nSince their debut, BIGBANG members have played leading role in making their own music and performances, to enjoy big popularity from music fans for their unique color. Notably, G-DRAGON\u2019s producing greatly contributed to maintenance of BIGBANG\u2019s special color. Along with G-DRAGON\u2019s growth as an artist, the quality of BIGBANG\u2019s albums has also grown. BIGBANG\u2019s hit songs such as \u201cV.I.P\u201d, \u201cDIRTY CASH\u201d, \u201cLIES\u201d, \u201cHARU HARU\u201d, \u201cLAST FAREWELL\u201d, \u201cFANTASTIC BABY\u201d, \u201cSTILL ALIVE\u201d, and \u201cMONSTER\u201d were all born from G-DRAGON and the other members of BIGBANG.\r\n\r\nNotably, \u201cLIES\u201d recorded mega-hit, making BIGBANG the top idol group in Korea. BIGBANG received their first No.1 trophy in a TV music show for the song and swept trophies in music awards at the end of that year. Every song released since then recorded big hit. On the basis of the remarkable success of BIGBANG, each member performed as solo artists and in unit teams, giving even bigger fame to BIGBANG.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIGBANG was away from the music scene for three years since \u201cSTILL ALIVE\u201d album. BIGBANG\u2019s potential was proven once again when they made comeback after three years of hiatus. Last year, BIGBANG carried out \u201cMADE\u201d project in which they released one single every month for fans who had been longing for BIGBANG\u2019s music. The project was a great success. Single \u201cM\u201d, \u201cA\u201d, \u201cD\u201d, and \u201cE\u201d released from May to August last year all swept top places on charts and TV music shows. All songs in those albums including \u201cLOSER\u201d, \u201cBAE BAE\u201d, \u201cBANG BANG BANG\u201d, \u201cIF YOU\u201d, \u201cSOBER\u201d, \u201cZUTTER\u201d (GD&amp;T.O.P), and \u201cLET\u2019S NOT FALL IN LOVE\u201d created sensation and BIGBANG swept trophies in music awards at the end of last year. Notably, \u201cBANG BANG BANG\u201d and \u201cLOSER\u201d surpassed 100 million views on video-streaming website \u201cYouTube\u201d, following \u201cFANTASTIC BABY\u201d and \u201cGOOD BOY\u201d. With the record, BIGBANG became the first Korean boy group who has four music videos that have reached the 100 million view mark on YouTube.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe reason why BIGBANG is recognized is not just because of the large number of their hit songs and trophies they have received. Other than Korea\u2019s longest-lived boy group SHINHWA, BIGBANG is the only idol boy group in Korea who has performed for more than 10 years without any change in the members. That enhances BIGBANG\u2019s value even further.\r\n\r\nBIGBANG is not just a long-lived idol boy group. The name BIGBANG has enormous influence. Last year, BIGBANG held world tour \u201cMADE\u201d in 32 cities of 13 countries. Total 66 concerts were held in the tour and more than one and a half million people went to the concerts. A concert held at LA Staples Center in the United States was included in the list of \u201cworld\u2019s top 10 highest-earning concerts\u201d selected by Billboard (total 13,361 entrances, $1,715,587\/$1,940,000,000 of ticket revenues).\r\n\r\nPlus, BIGBANG has recently been appointed as \u201cCREATIVE ICON\u201d selected by the Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism to promote Korea\u2019s new national brand \u201cCREATIVE KOREA\u201d throughout the world. BIGBANG will work as the PR ambassador for \u201cCREATIVE KOREA\u201d until the PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games in 2018. BIGBANG\u2019s appointment as \u201cCREATIVE ICON\u201d is the proof of BIGBANG\u2019s big influence on people of all age groups in the entire world.\r\n\r\nAfter their constant growth for the past 10 years since debut, BIGBANG is now celebrating the 10th\u00a0anniversary of their debut. BIGBANG has recently been celebrating the 10th\u00a0anniversary with fans in documentary movie, exhibition, and concerts. As BIGBANG is still the top idol boy group in Korea in the 10th\u00a0year of their debut, constantly writing new history in music, it will be worthwhile to look forward to their next 10 years.\r\n\r\n2016. 8. 19.","post_date":"2016-08-30","related_blog":[],"main_image":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/201608190006386661931_20160819001231_01_99_20160819064107.jpg","thumb_2x1":false,"thumb_3x2":false},"868":{"id":868,"post_title":"[New Songs is] CL to make debut in the United States soon boasts sexy swag\u2026 Groove \u2191","url_friendly_name":"new-songs-is-cl-to-make-debut-in-the-united-states-soon-boasts-sexy-swag-groove-%e2%86%91","excerpt":"","post_content":"\r\n\r\n\r\n[\uc77c\uac04\uc2a4\ud3ec\uce20=\ud669\ubbf8\ud604 \uae30\uc790]\u00a0Group 2NE1\u2019s CL unveiled the first single for her official debut in the United States.

The teenaged boys have now become men in their late 20s and they stayed in top of the music scene for 10 years. During that time, numerous boy bands have appeared, shone, and disappeared. However, BIGBANG has established themselves as the idol of idol singers, firmly maintaining their own color.\r\n\r\nJust as the name \u201cbigbang\u201d suggests, BIGBANG has created sensation for every step they took forward. YG Entertainment recruited trainees to find out talents in singing and dancing, as well as a variety of field. G-DRAGON, T.O.P, TAEYANG, DAESUNG, and SEUNGRI were selected as the members of BIGBANG, after winning a survival audition.\r\n\r\nBIGBANG gave their first performance on the stage of YG Family\u2019s 10th anniversary concert held in 2006 at Seoul Olympic Gymnastics Arena. Then, they released first single album \u201cLa La La\u201d and then second single album \u201cBigBang Is V.I.P\u201d. In December that year, BIGBANG released their first full album and held first concert.\r\n\r\nThe time when BIGBANG \u2018s success became more striking was when \u201cLIES\u201d and \u201cLAST FAREWELL\u201d included in their first mini-album made big hit in 2007. The two songs stayed in No.1 on music charts for seven and eight weeks, respectively, enjoying popularity from fans and music lovers of a wide range of age groups. That year, BIGBANG received best male group award and song of the year award in Mnet\u2019s KM Music Festival.\r\n\r\nAfter their debut in Korea, BIGBANG also made debut in Japan. Then, each member began to perform as solo artists, from 2008. TAEYANG released \u201cOnly Look At Me\u201d to get recognized for good performance and singing. Then, he released \u201cHARU HARU\u201d and \u201cSunset Glow\u201d remade from Lee Munse\u2019s song, to become top idol boy band.\r\n\r\nBIGBANG has the root of their music in the hip-hop genre polished by YG so far, but they transplanted popular melody in it. In early days of BIGBANG\u2019s debut, YG\u2019s planning and production exerted big influence on the direction of BIGBANG\u2019s music and performance, but as BIGBANG members themselves took part in their own members more and more, BIGBANG\u2019s unique color was added to the team\u2019s music and performances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nG-DRAGON presented trendy music that went well with his fashion, in his first solo album \u201cHeartbreaker\u201d released in 2009. TAEYANG released his solo track \u201cWedding Dress\u201d and T.O.P, DAESUNG, and SEUNGRI displayed their talent in TV dramas, musicals, and TV shows. The success of BIGBANG made each member of the team spread their wings in a variety of fields.\r\n\r\nBIGBANG held concerts overseas and swept music awards. Then, in 2011, BIGBANG released their fourth mini-album \u201cTonight\u201d. That year, BIGBANG made big success with their music, but DAESUNG got involved in a car accident and a scandal of G-DRAGON\u2019s weed smoking emerged, to become a topic of gossips.\r\n\r\nThat crisis could have led to a slump. However, fifth mini album \u201cAlive\u201d released in 2012 gave BIGBANG an opportunity for a new leap forward. As BIGBANG said \u201cAll the six songs in the album are title tracks\u201d, \u201cBLUE\u201d, \u2018BAD BOY\u201d, and \u201cFANTASTIC BABY\u201d boasted perfect quality. The album made a record hit, taking the 150th place on \u201cBillboard 200\u201d, American Billboard\u2019s main albums chart.\r\n\r\nBIGBANG members concentrated on their solo careers again in 2013. DAESUNG released his first full album in Japan and SEUNGRI released his second solo mini-album. G-DRAGON released second full album \u201cCOUP D\u2019ETAT\u201d and TAEYANG released his second full album \u201cRISE\u201d. T.O.P appeared in movie \u201cThe Commitment\u201d and released digital single album \u201cDOOM DADA\u201d.\r\n\r\nIn celebration of the fifth anniversary of their debut in Japan, BIGBANG held five dome tours in the country, to attract total 741,000 fans to 15 concerts of the tours in five cities. BIGBANG held seven concerts at Osaka Kyocera Dome, setting the record of the longest period of concert at dome by a foreign artist.\r\n\r\nLast year, BIGBANG announced news of their new release, and then carried out \u201cM.A.D.E\u201d project, releasing a single album every month from May to August. During the period, \u201cLOSER\u201d, \u201cBAE BAE\u201d, \u201cBANG BANG BANG\u201d, \u201cIF YOU\u201d, and other songs of \u201cM.A.D.E\u201d albums took No.1 on music charts.\r\n\r\nBIGBANG released documentary film \u201cBIGBANG MADE\u201d that showed BIGBANG\u2019s performances in tour and their daily lives, in celebration of the 10th anniversary of debut. Then, exhibition \u201cBIGBANG EXHIBITION A to Z\u201d was held. Now, on August 20, a concert for celebration of the 10th anniversary of BIGBANG\u2019s debut will be held, to spend the meaningful day with fans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2016. 8. 19.","post_date":"2016-08-30","related_blog":[],"main_image":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/20160818_3048162_1471566786_99_20160819112903.jpg","thumb_2x1":false,"thumb_3x2":false},"864":{"id":864,"post_title":"[People is] BLACKPINK got 10 proposals for modeling for TV commercials within 10 days of debut\u2026 \u201cCreating sensation\u201d","url_friendly_name":"people-is-blackpink-got-10-proposals-for-modeling-for-tv-commercials-within-10-days-of-debut-creating-sensation","excerpt":"","post_content":"\r\n\r\n\r\n[\uc77c\uac04\uc2a4\ud3ec\uce20=\ud669\ubbf8\ud604 \uae30\uc790]\u00a0Group BLACKPINK has received more than 10 proposals for modeling in TV commercials, within 10 days of their debut. It is an unprecedented record for a rookie artist.\r\n\r\nAccording to advertisement industry\u2019s insiders on August 19, BLACKPINK has received more than 10 proposals for modeling in TV commercials within 10 days of their debut, for their pretty appearance and stylish image. Most of the proposals are from sports and clothing brands. It is a very rare case for a rookie artist who has just debuted to draw big attention in the TV commercial industry like BLACKPINK. Such situation is proving the big potential of BLACKPINK armed with outstanding beauty and talent once again.\r\n\r\nCurrently, BLACKPINK is carefully thinking about for what TV commercials they will sign contract. Rather than accepting all the proposals, BLACKPINK is trying to select ones that suit their image. BLACKPINK has already signed contracts for two commercials and will keep discussing on the rest of commercials as well.\r\n\r\nInsiders said, \u201cEven though BLACKPINK is a rookie artist, the unprecedented records set by them since their debut have firmly established BLACKPINK\u2019s good image. Their pretty look and unique sense of style are drawing big attention from the advertisement industry\u201d.\r\n\r\nBLACKPINK made official debut on August 8. Upon the release of their debut songs, BLACKPINK swept all music charts, showing enormous potential as a \u201cmonstrous rookie\u201d. \u201cWHISTLE\u201d and \u201cBOOMBAYAH\u201d, the double title tracks of BLACKPINK\u2019s debut album, are recording 14,447,441 views and 16,826,103 views on YouTube, respectively, as of August 19.

Ten years ago, YG Entertainment (\u201cYG\u201d) selected the members of new idol group BIGBANG through survival audition show Mnet \u201cReal-docu BIGBANG\u201d. Such format of TV shows is common these days, but back then, there was no TV show that revealed the whole process of production of an idol group. BIGBANG drew big attention as the first idol boy group of YG and the TV show recorded more than million views.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cReal-docu BIGBANG\u201d left a big impression to the public as the first-ever survival audition show and it also became an unforgettable memory for BIGBANG members. In a press meeting of \u201cA to Z\u201d exhibition held in celebration of the 10thanniversary of BIGBANG\u2019s debut, G-DRAGON said, \u201cThe best thing I\u2019ve ever done in my life was my refusal to go home when Mr. YANG told me to go home. Another was when SEUNGRI explained the reason why he had to join BIGBANG\u201d, making viewers burst into laughter.\r\n\r\nBIGBANG who had a sole purpose of debut back then has now become the role model for Korean idol groups, and they have established themselves as the center of K-pop, being recognized globally. In Korea\u2019s music scene, BIGBANG has always at the center of interest.\r\n\r\nFirst, BIGBANG suggested a new direction for idol groups that had been planned in a strict framework of music labels. Starting from G-DRAGON, BIGBANG members wrote their own songs for albums from the very debut, setting a good model for idol producers. The reason why many idol singers now are boasting their capabilities as producers such as in the case of Block-B\u2019s ZICO, Jinyoung of B1A4, Jung Yong-hwa of CNBLUE, BTS, and Woozi of Seventeen is all attributable to BIGBANG\u2019s trial.\r\n\r\nBIGBANG also showed the fact that even for a team, each member\u2019s capabilities are important. Exceptionally for an idol group, all the members of BIGBANG released solo albums and those solo albums showed new music totally different from team BIGBANG\u2019s music. TAEYANG presented R&amp;B that best-suits his voice, and T.O.P presented more powerful and intense rap as a solo artist. DAESUNG tried trot, the genre of adult pop with a little color of Korean traditional music, which was a very rare case for an idol singer. G-DRAGON presented more experimental music in his solo albums.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIGBANG also proved the fact that an idol group can be split into different unit teams, not just into individual solo artists. GD&amp;T.O.P unit team of rappers and the unit team of GD&amp;TAEYANG who are also closest friends, have created bigger sensation.\r\n\r\nBIGBANG went beyond the music scene and has become the icon of fashion, leading trends. BIGBANG members are not typical handsome guys, but they have unique style and sense of fashion and they have always tried new styles. The items that BIGBANG wore for \u201cLIES\u201d released in 2007 including high-top sneakers, bandanas, and caps created sensation as \u201cit\u201d fashion items. Ever since then, BIGBANG has always presented experimental styles. Notably, G-DRAGON emerged as a fashionista, being recognized as a celebrity not only in Korea but also globally. World-famous luxury brand Louis Vuitton invested in YG, which well-demonstrates BIGBANG\u2019s enormous potential in the fashion world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIGBANG is now the icon that represents Korea. BIGBANG has recently been appointed as the PR ambassador for Korea\u2019s new national brand \u201cCREATIVE KOREA\u201d. BIGBANG will work as the PR ambassador from the 2016 Rio Olympics until the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games.\r\n\r\nMost of all, it is hard to find any other idol groups than SHINHWA and BIGBANG who have maintained the team for more than 10 years. Plus, BIGBANG has worked with the same company for those 10 years. There have been some scandals for the 10 years including suspicion that G-DRAGON smoked weed and car accidents of DAESUNG and SEUNGRI, but still, BIGBANG maintained the team and stayed in the top place. That shows how exceptionally meaningful BIGBANG is in Korea\u2019s music scene.\r\n\r\n2016. 8. 19.","post_date":"2016-08-30","related_blog":[],"main_image":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/822600810100_99_20160819100309.jpg","thumb_2x1":false,"thumb_3x2":false},"860":{"id":860,"post_title":"[Entertainment History] Looking Back on the Past 10 Years of BIGBANG, Who Transformed From Teenagers to Global Stars","url_friendly_name":"entertainment-history-looking-back-on-the-past-10-years-of-bigbang-who-transformed-from-teenagers-to-global-stars","excerpt":"","post_content":"\r\n\r\n[\uc77c\uac04\uc2a4\ud3ec\uce20=\ud669\ubbf8\ud604 \uae30\uc790]\u00a0BIGBANG debuted with \u201cWE BELONG TOGETHER\u201d and \u201cLALALA\u201d in 2006, and the group became a star instantly.

G-DRAGON himself wrote the lyrics of the album\u2019s title track \u201cDIRTY CASH\u201d. The members look trendy and hip wearing their jeans down and tops with patterns. The album sold 48,000 copies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u25b6August 2007\r\n\r\nBIGBANG debuted exactly ten years ago from today, and their biggest hit song \u201cLIES\u201d is climbing back up on the charts. This is because \u201cLIES\u201d is like the signature song of BIGBANG. BIGBANG made a grand comeback with \u201cLIES\u201d performing the song in white costumes. \u201cLIES\u201d is also written and composed by G-DRAGON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u25b6November 2007\r\n\r\nThis was when BIGBANG released their second EP album \u201cHOT ISSUE\u201d.

The title track of the album \u201cHARU HARU\u201d is co-composed by G-DRAGON and Daishi Dance, a Japanese DJ\/composer. The album sold 166,000 copies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u25b6November 2008\r\n\r\nBIGBANG\u2019s \u201cSUNSET GLOW\u201d was and still is loved by many. The overall concept of the song was bright and lively, and BIGBANG members sang the song with big smiles on their faces, which made many people fall in love with them all over again. More than 20,000 copies of \u201cREMEMBER\u201d, the album that contained \u201cSUNSET GLOW\u201d, were sold on preorders alone. BIGBANG\u2019s \u201cSUNSET GLOW\u201d is a remake of Lee Moon-se\u2019s \u201cSUNSET GLOW\u201d, which was released in 1988. Usually singers sample the chorus part of the original version, but BIGBANG put their feel into the song, making it sound like a totally different song.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u25b6February 2011\r\n\r\nThey released their fourth EP album \u201cTONIGHT\u201d after a two-year break. By this time, BIGBANG members no longer looked like boys but like men and became the heartthrob of many girls. The album topped the charts in just seven days\u00a0after its release, and the title track of the album \u201cTONIGHT\u201d swept the charts upon release.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u25b6February 2012\r\n\r\nBIGBANG released their fifth mini-album after a one-year hiatus. All the songs of the album were title tracks, which sent shockwaves across the music industry. G-DRAGON received much media attention thanks to his long side hair in the music video of \u201cFANTASTIC BABY\u201d. The album sold 260,000 copies on preorders alone and more than 200,000 copies in just a month. With this song, BIGBANG became no.150 on Billboard\u2019s top 200 albums chart. It was the first time that a Korean artist made it so high on Billboard\u2019s charts with a song sung in Korean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u25b6June 2012\r\n\r\nBIGBANG released a special album titled \u201cSTILL ALIVE\u201d for their fans who were longing for their comeback. \u201cSTILL ALIVE\u201d contains the tracks in BIGBANG\u2019s \u201cALIVE\u201d album plus four new tracks, including \u201cMONSTER\u201d. The album sold 100,000 copies in just a month after its release.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u25b6May 2015\r\n\r\nIn 2015, BIGBANG released single albums every month from May to August under a project named \u201cMADE\u201d. Every time a new single was released, it topped the charts. As a result, BIGBANG dominated the chart for four months straight.

The five members of BIGBANG on the stage and 65,000 fans in the audience all shone bright like stars.\r\n\r\nAt 7 PM on August 20, \u201cBIGBANG10 THE CONCERT: 0.TO.10\u201d took place at the World Cup Stadium in Sangam-dong to celebrate the 10th\u00a0anniversary of BIGBANG\u2019s debut. BIGBANG debuted exactly ten years ago on August 19, and they decided to hold a large-scale concert to share the joy with their fans.\r\n\r\nA whopping 65,000 fans from in and out of Korea flocked to Sangam-dong. Originally, the concert was to hold only 60,000 people, but because there were so many requests from those who couldn\u2019t get tickets, extra tickets for the restricted-view seats were opened for sale later on. Not only Korean fans but also fans from all around the world came to see BIGBANG on the stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u25c6BIGBANG heated up the stage from the very beginning.\r\n\r\nBIGBANG kicked off the concert with \u201cHEAVEN\u201d. The audience went wild as soon as the concert started. BIGBANG was covered in sweat even when they were singing their first song. After \u201cHEAVEN\u201d, BIGBANG sang \u201cWE LIKE TO PARTY\u201d and \u201cHANDS UP\u201d. They ran about the stage trying to make eye contact with those on the second and third floor and even those in restricted-view seats.\r\n\r\nBIGBANG has been around for ten years now, and so, they had no trouble making witty introductions at the beginning of the concert. G-DRAGON introduced himself, \u201cHello, I\u2019m G-DRAGON, and I\u2019ve been leading BIGBANG for ten years now.\u201d T.O.P said, \u201cYour lights are making our hearts warm. Let\u2019s rock the night away.\u201d DAESUNG shouted out, \u201cIt\u2019s already hot tonight. But let\u2019s make it hotter!\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter BIGBANG sang \u201cBAD BOY\u201d and \u201cLOSER\u201d, SEUNGRI turned into a DJ and played a medley of their hit songs. \u201cWe have so many songs that we couldn\u2019t sing them all at a concert\u201d, SEUNGRI explained why he prepared his special DJing performance. The medley included a number of BIGBANG\u2019s hit songs such as \u201cFEAR\u201d, \u201cLOLLIPOP\u201d, and \u201cSTILL ALIVE\u201d and made the audience very happy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u25c6BIGBANG is great together and apart.\r\n\r\nWhat followed afterwards was a thing that only BIGBANG could do. SEUNGRI performed his solo singles \u201cLET\u2019S TALK ABOUT LOVE\u201d and \u201cSTRONG BABY\u201d. DAESUNG sang \u201cWINGS\u201d and \u201cLOOK AT ME GWISOON\u201d. Then the two sang G-DRAGON\u2019s \u201cCROOKED\u201d to the surprise of the audience.\r\n\r\nG-DRAGON performed \u201cHEARTBREAKER\u201d and \u201cCRAYON\u201d for his solo stage. Then he sang \u201cHIGH HIGH\u201d with T.O.P and \u201cGOOD BOY\u201d with TAEYANG. His charisma on the stage made the audience go wild and proved that he is indeed a star.\r\n\r\nThen it was T.O.P\u2019s turn. He sang \u201cACT LIKE NOTHING IS WRONG\u201d and \u201cDOOM DADA\u201d. Next, TAEYANG performed \u201cEYES, NOSE, LIPS\u201d, \u201cLOOK AT ME ONLY\u201d, and \u201cRINGA LINGA\u201d. He sang all the songs live and they were all flawless. All these performances were only possible because BIGBANG members all released solo albums.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u25c6 A journey of the past 10 years of BIGBANG\r\n\r\nAs the concert went on, BIGBANG members and the audience began enjoying the concert as if they were one. BIGBANG sang their mega hit songs as well as their recent hit songs such as \u201cIF YOU\u201d, \u201cHARU HARU\u201d, \u201cBANG BANG BANG\u201d, \u201cFANTASITC BABY\u201d and \u201cSOBER\u201d and enthralled the audience.\r\n\r\nFor their closing remarks, members said, \u201cWe are trying to draw the big picture for the next ten years of BIGBANG. We hope you\u2019ll keep on sending us your support. Once again, thank you for your support during the past ten years. We\u2019ll keep on creating great music and putting on great performances. Thank you.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe heat and the roar of in Sangam-dong were strong enough to be felt on the other side of the earth. For their encore stage, BIGBANG sang \u201cLAST FAREWELL\u201d, \u201cSUNSET GLOW\u201d, \u201cLIES\u201d, \u201cALWAYS\u201d, and \u201cBAE BAE\u201d. During the two and a half hour concert, the five members of BIGBANG and 65,000 fans truly became one.

They must have missed doing a concert in Korea. Five months have passed since they last held a concert in Korea, which was when they did their \u201cMADE\u201d concert in March. As if they missed talking in their mother tongue, they chattered a lot during the concert.\r\n\r\n\u25cb\u2026DAESUNG, who is known to be the most friendly member of BIGBANG, said hi in a rather unique way. He said, \u201cHello, I\u2019m your\u00a0nurungji\u00a0and your\u00a0cheonggukjang.\u00a0Would you like to go to heaven with me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u25cb\u2026SEUNGRI revealed what T.O.P said to the members.

I really want today\u2019s concert to go well.\u201d SEUNGRI went on to say, \u201cT.O.P cries a lot these days. Whenever he does that, I make fun of him by saying that female hormones are taking hold of him because he\u2019s getting old\u201d.\r\n\r\n\u25cb\u2026G-DRAGON talked about how the meaning of August has changed since 2006. He said, \u201cBefore joining YG, August was just a month I was born in. But after 2006, it has become a special month during which I think about the meaning of the members and our fans a lot. I\u2019m so happy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u25cb\u2026TAEYANG thanked the staff for their hard work. He said, \u201cWe don\u2019t do much. We make music, and we sing and dance on the stage that is already made for us. The staff members including Mr. Yang made us who we are today. Of course, our fans played the biggest part.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u25cb\u2026When the concert was nearing to its end, there was a short poem-making time. DAESUNG asked SEUNGRI to make a poem with \u201c10th\u00a0anniversary.\u201d SEUNGRI made a poem that goes, \u201cIt has already been 10 years. You and I exchanged love. In Yanbian\u201d and made rest of the members boo him. DAESUNG was asked to do the same. His poem went, \u201cHas it been ten years already? I will remember every second, every minute, every day, and every week of it. We must be lovers. I love you\u201d and, DAESUNG received a big applause for it.\r\n\r\n\u25cb\u2026BIGBANG\u2019s \u201cMADE\u201d movie hit the box office in June. BIGBANG promised that they would reveal a video showing SEUNGRI taking a shower if the movie scores 100,000 viewers. But unfortunately, they did not get a chance to keep the promise. Afterwards, BIGBANG announced they would reveal the video at their concert. SEUNGRI made the audience laugh by saying that they shouldn\u2019t do it because his parents and relatives are at the concert.\r\n\r\n2016. 8. 21.","post_date":"2016-08-30","related_blog":[],"main_image":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/1471701639271_1_230446_99_20160821071804.jpg","thumb_2x1":false,"thumb_3x2":false},"846":{"id":846,"post_title":"PSY Said, \u201cWhat YANG HYUN SUK said ten years ago came true.

The concert demonstrated that BIGBANG still has strong presence on Korea\u2019s music scene and a wide fan base.\r\n\r\n65,000 people holding yellow crown sticks got together in Sangam-dong, and even before the concert started, they were cheering loudly. The heat at the concert was hotter than the record-breaking heat wave that struck Seoul.\r\n\r\nBIGBANG led the audience to a heavenly bliss by singing \u201cHEAVEN\u201d and signaled the beginning of a great party with \u201cWE LIKE 2 PARTY\u201d. The concert was a shortened version of the past ten years of BIGBANG. BIGBANG sang their hit songs such as \u201cBAD BOY\u201d, \u201cLOSER\u201d, \u201cIF YOU\u201d, \u201cHARU HARU\u201d, \u201cBANG BANG BANG\u201d, \u201cFANTASTIC BABY\u201d, \u201cSOBER\u201d, \u201cLAST FAREWELL\u201d, \u201cSUNSET GLOW\u201d, and \u201cLIES\u201d without stopping for one moment. 65,000 fans sang along to the songs and heated up the 10thanniversary party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIGBANG also did solo and unit performances. All the members of BIGBANG had released solo singles and had formed unit groups. The solo and unit performances took up a third of the total concert time, providing a chance for the fans to have a taste of each member\u2019s music.\r\n\r\nMaybe it was because the 10th\u00a0anniversary had such a big meaning to them or maybe it was something else, but BIGBANG talked a lot during the concert. Although they were charismatic during performances, they went back to their usual cheerful and fun selves and chatted away with their fans. They were funny and witty, making the concert even more joyful for the fans. Most of all, they were thankful to their fans.\r\n\r\nG-DRAGON thanked the fans by saying, \u201cBefore I joined YG, August was just a month I was born in. But now, it has become a special month that makes me think about our fans and the members a lot. I\u2019d like to thank you once again because I truly believe that you made us who we are today. I hope you keep on sending your support. Time flies. The past ten years have gone past so quickly. I hope that we\u2019ll be able to perform for you and be with you for another ten years.\u201d\r\n\r\nTAEYANG said, \u201cA lot has happened during the past ten years. I didn\u2019t expect so many people to come to this concert. Thank you for allowing us to sing for ten years. We\u2019ve been busy every day. We\u2019re trying to draw the big picture for the next ten years of BIGBANG.\u201d\r\n\r\nT.O.P started to tear up when it was his turn to make remarks. He said, \u201cI have a lot to be thankful for. I\u2019ve had a lot of happy moments during the past ten years as well as moments that I don\u2019t want to remember. I\u2019d like to thank the fans for being with me and supporting me all the way through.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSince it was a 10th\u00a0anniversary concert, there were many unexpected scenes both in and out of the stadium. The set was glamorous and magnificent, and many new records were set.\r\n\r\nFor starters, the number of audience was extraordinary. As much as 65,000 people came to see BIGBANG, and it was the biggest number for a single concert in Korea. The tickets were all sold out, even the tickets to the view-restricted seats. The audience consisted of people from various age groups from those in their teens to those in their 40s and 50s. There were fans from outside of Korea, and some male fans dressed up as G-DRAGON.\r\n\r\nBIGBANG members have held concerts all around the world, but when they saw that the stadium was filled with fans from all around the world, they couldn\u2019t help but feel impressed and thankful.\r\n\r\nSEUNGRI said, \u201cThank you for coming to our 10th\u00a0anniversary concert. I didn\u2019t expect so many people would come to the concert because this is originally a football stadium.\u201d TAEYANG said, \u201cI\u2019m so happy that we could celebrate our 10th\u00a0anniversary with so many people. If we had known so many would come, we would have held concerts for two days.\u201d G-DRAGON said with a big smile on his face, \u201cI was worried that we would not be popular in Korea because we\u2019ve been out a lot. But I know now that there was no need to worry.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe set and the installations were phenomenal. It was a big stadium, but the stage was big and glamorous enough to fill the stadium. Thanks to the cutting-edge installations, BIGBANG members were able to sing on different sets every time. The splendid LED screen and lights made the concert even more glamorous. Delay speakers were installed at a total of ten spots to provide best quality sound to the audience.\r\n\r\nThere was also a three storey, 14m-long and 14m-high lift in the shape of a pyramid on the stage. The front part of the stage could be lifted as high as 8 meters. The stage was mostly made of large lifts. There were four outdoor broadcasting vans, 30 cameras, and wire cams to shoot every corner of the stage and the stadium.\r\n\r\nThings were just as hot outside the stadium.\r\n\r\nThe hot weather couldn\u2019t get in the way of the fans. Those who got standing seat tickets started to get in line from the morning to get the best view of the stage. There were crowds of people even from the subway station when it was time for the concert to begin, and they had to wait for a long time just to get in the stadium. There were also scalpers and fans who couldn\u2019t get the tickets wandering outside of the stadium.\r\n\r\nBIGBANG\u2019s 10th\u00a0anniversary concert was indeed a huge blast. BIGBANG has created another legend with the concert.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2016. 8. 21.","post_date":"2016-08-30","related_blog":[],"main_image":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/1471701639271_1_230446_99_20160821071804.jpg","thumb_2x1":false,"thumb_3x2":false},"841":{"id":841,"post_title":"[Review is] BIGBANG Went Crazy on Stage and Fans Went Crazy because They Wanted to See More","url_friendly_name":"review-is-bigbang-went-crazy-on-stage-and-fans-went-crazy-because-they-wanted-to-see-more","excerpt":"","post_content":"\r\n\r\n\r\n[\uc77c\uac04\uc2a4\ud3ec\uce20=\uc774\ubbf8\ud604 \uae30\uc790]\u00a0It was a concert that only BIGBANG could pull off. Fans from all around the world came to Sangam-dong to celebrate the 10th\u00a0anniversary of BIGBANG. The five members of BIGBANG on the stage and 65,000 fans in the audience all shone bright like stars.\r\n\r\nAt 7 PM on August 20, \u201cBIGBANG10 THE CONCERT: 0.TO.10\u201d took place at the World Cup Stadium in Sangam-dong to celebrate the 10th\u00a0anniversary of BIGBANG\u2019s debut. BIGBANG debuted exactly ten years ago on August 19, and they decided to hold a large-scale concert to share the joy with their fans.\r\n\r\nA whopping 65,000 fans from in and out of Korea flocked to Sangam-dong. Originally, the concert was to hold only 60,000 people, but because there were so many requests from those who couldn\u2019t get tickets, extra tickets for the restricted-view seats were opened for sale later on. Not only Korean fans but also fans from all around the world came to see BIGBANG on the stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u25c6BIGBANG heated up the stage from the very beginning.\r\n\r\nBIGBANG kicked off the concert with \u201cHEAVEN\u201d. The audience went wild as soon as the concert started. BIGBANG was covered in sweat even when they were singing their first song. After \u201cHEAVEN\u201d, BIGBANG sang \u201cWE LIKE TO PARTY\u201d and \u201cHANDS UP\u201d. They ran about the stage trying to make eye contact with those on the second and third floor and even those in restricted-view seats.\r\n\r\nBIGBANG has been around for ten years now, and so, they had no trouble making witty introductions at the beginning of the concert. G-DRAGON introduced himself, \u201cHello, I\u2019m G-DRAGON, and I\u2019ve been leading BIGBANG for ten years now.\u201d T.O.P said, \u201cYour lights are making our hearts warm. Let\u2019s rock the night away.\u201d DAESUNG shouted out, \u201cIt\u2019s already hot tonight. But let\u2019s make it hotter!\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter BIGBANG sang \u201cBAD BOY\u201d and \u201cLOSER\u201d, SEUNGRI turned into a DJ and played a medley of their hit songs. \u201cWe have so many songs that we couldn\u2019t sing them all at a concert\u201d, SEUNGRI explained why he prepared his special DJing performance. The medley included a number of BIGBANG\u2019s hit songs such as \u201cFEAR\u201d, \u201cLOLLIPOP\u201d, and \u201cSTILL ALIVE\u201d and made the audience very happy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u25c6BIGBANG is great together and apart.\r\n\r\nWhat followed afterwards was a thing that only BIGBANG could do. SEUNGRI performed his solo singles \u201cLET\u2019S TALK ABOUT LOVE\u201d and \u201cSTRONG BABY\u201d. DAESUNG sang \u201cWINGS\u201d and \u201cLOOK AT ME GWISOON\u201d. Then the two sang G-DRAGON\u2019s \u201cCROOKED\u201d to the surprise of the audience.\r\n\r\nG-DRAGON performed \u201cHEARTBREAKER\u201d and \u201cCRAYON\u201d for his solo stage. Then he sang \u201cHIGH HIGH\u201d with T.O.P and \u201cGOOD BOY\u201d with TAEYANG. His charisma on the stage made the audience go wild and proved that he is indeed a star.\r\n\r\nThen it was T.O.P\u2019s turn. He sang \u201cACT LIKE NOTHING IS WRONG\u201d and \u201cDOOM DADA\u201d. Next, TAEYANG performed \u201cEYES, NOSE, LIPS\u201d, \u201cLOOK AT ME ONLY\u201d, and \u201cRINGA LINGA\u201d. He sang all the songs live and they were all flawless. All these performances were only possible because BIGBANG members all released solo albums.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u25c6 A journey of the past 10 years of BIGBANG\r\n\r\nAs the concert went on, BIGBANG members and the audience began enjoying the concert as if they were one. BIGBANG sang their mega hit songs as well as their recent hit songs such as \u201cIF YOU\u201d, \u201cHARU HARU\u201d, \u201cBANG BANG BANG\u201d, \u201cFANTASITC BABY\u201d and \u201cSOBER\u201d and enthralled the audience.\r\n\r\nFor their closing remarks, members said, \u201cWe are trying to draw the big picture for the next ten years of BIGBANG. We hope you\u2019ll keep on sending us your support. Once again, thank you for your support during the past ten years. We\u2019ll keep on creating great music and putting on great performances. Thank you.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe heat and the roar of in Sangam-dong were strong enough to be felt on the other side of the earth. For their encore stage, BIGBANG sang \u201cLAST FAREWELL\u201d, \u201cSUNSET GLOW\u201d, \u201cLIES\u201d, \u201cALWAYS\u201d, and \u201cBAE BAE\u201d. During the two and a half hour concert, the five members of BIGBANG and 65,000 fans truly became one. History was written again on August 20, 2016.\r\n\r\n2016. 8. 21.","post_date":"2016-08-30","related_blog":[],"main_image":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/20160821_3049907_1471744777_99_20160821112304.jpg","thumb_2x1":false,"thumb_3x2":false},"839":{"id":839,"post_title":"In just 14 Days after Debut, BLACKPINK becomes Candidate for No.1 on the Charts","url_friendly_name":"in-just-14-days-after-debut-blackpink-becomes-candidate-for-no-1-on-the-charts","excerpt":"","post_content":"\r\n[\uc2a4\ud3ec\uce20\uc870\uc120\ub2f7\ucef4=\uc815\uc720\ub098 \uae30\uc790]\u00a0It\u2019s been only two weeks since BLACKPINK debuted, but the girl group became a candidate for the no.1 spot on Inkigayo\u2019s chart.

I\u2019ve never seen so many people at a concert in Korea. It was in 2006, and it was the day when I appeared on TV to promote \u201cCELEBRITY\u201d for the last time. YANG HYUN SUK and I were watching BIGBANG\u2019s debut stage. He said to me that \u2018Those guys will rock the world in the future\u2019. BIGBANG is a group that grows every day while maintaining their unique identity. \u201c\r\n\r\nPSY talked about BIGBANG\u2019s debut stage when he appeared as a guest at BIGBANG\u2019s 10th\u00a0anniversary concert, which took place on August 20 at the World Cup Stadium. The global star praised BIGBANG for keeping their style of music for the past ten years. The concert was indeed a journey into the past ten years of BIGBANG.\r\n\r\n65,000 people came to see BIGBANG despite the scorching heat, and the concert looked like a \u201clittle Asia.\u201d Fans from Japan, China, and even Southeast Asian countries cheered when the screen showed BIGBANG\u2019s hit-medley video before the concert.\r\n\r\nWhen the concert finally began at 7 PM, music videos of \u201cBAE BAE\u201d, \u201cLET\u2019S NOT FALL IN LOVE\u201d, and \u201cSOBER\u201d were played. Fans cheered loudly watching the faces of members on the screen. A video showing celebratory remarks and members was played afterwards.\r\n\r\nWearing silver costumes, BIGBANG members appeared on the main stage, which had a large three-storey pyramid lift. They shouted out, \u201c10th\u00a0anniversary of BIGBANG! Let\u2019s start the party!\u201d and sang \u201cWE LIKE 2 PARTY\u201d. G-DRAGON, TAEYANG, SEUNGRI went up on a lift on one side and T.O.P and DAESUNG on another one so that they could move to the very end of the stage.\r\n\r\nUnlike other singers who go on a lift when the concert is coming to an end, BIGBANG heated up the atmosphere by moving via lifts at the very beginning of their concert. For the \u201cHANDS UP\u201d performance, members changed lifts.\r\n\r\nG-DRAGON said, \u201cHi, I\u2019m G-DRAGON and I\u2019ve been the leader of BIGBANG for ten years now. I hope you enjoy the concert.\u201d DAESUNG thanked the audience for coming to their concert in such a hot weather by saying, \u201cIt\u2019s already hot. But let\u2019s heat things up and enjoy the party!\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIGBANG then performed \u201cBAD BOY\u201d and \u201cLOSER\u201d. Because of the hot weather, the members looked tired at times, but they quickly regained strength and continued on. To prevent the audience from fainting, the members gave time for them to take short rests.\r\n\r\nThe concert was filmed to be released as a DVD, and this was why YG Entertainment put so much into the concert. The stage consisted mainly of large lifts, and four outdoor broadcasting vans, 30 cameras, and a wire-cam were used to record BIGBANG\u2019s concert. The members didn\u2019t forget to look at the camera during their performances.\r\n\r\nThree large LED screens were installed, one on the main stage and two on the side, so that the audience don\u2019t miss a moment. Delay speakers were placed at ten spots to provide high-quality sound to all the seats. Every time BIGBANG finished singing a song, fireworks went off. The sound and the set were fabulous, fit for the 10th\u00a0anniversary concert of BIGBANG.\r\n\r\nWhen it was his time to say a word, DAESUNG said, \u201cI wanted to do a concert in Korea because I love your passion. I would like to thank those who have come from other countries too.\u201d G-DRAGON said, \u201cI was worried that we wouldn\u2019t be popular in Korea because we\u2019ve been doing concerts outside of Korea for such a long time. Thank you all for coming.\u201d\r\n\r\nBIGBANG members also did solo performances. DAESUNG sang \u201cWINGS\u201d and \u201cLOOK AT ME GWISOON\u201d in a jacket that had embroidered arms. He sang G-DRAGON\u2019s \u201cCROOKED\u201d with SEUNGRI after SEUNGRI finished his \u201cSTRONG BABY\u201d performance.\r\n\r\nG-DRAGON sang \u201cHEARTBREAKER\u201d and \u201cCRAYON\u201d, TAEYANG sang \u201cEYES, NOSE, LIPS\u201d, \u201cLOOK AT ME ONLY\u201d, and T.O.P performed \u201cACT LIKE NOTHING IS WRONG\u201d and \u201cDOOM DADA\u201d for their solo performances. In between solo performances, members put on unit performances such as GD&amp;T.O.P\u2019s \u201cHIGH HIGH\u201d and GD&amp;TAEYANG\u2019s \u201cGOOD BOY\u201d.\r\n\r\nBIGBANG debuted at YG Family\u2019s 10th\u00a0anniversary concert, which was held at Olympic Gymnastics Stadium on August 19, 2006. For the past ten years, BIGBANG have done their style of music. BIGBANG\u2019s melodies are pleasant to the ear, yet, their music has its roots in hip-hop, the main genre of YG Entertainment. The five \u201cbad boys\u201d of BIGBANG made a decade worth of YG\u2019s know-how into their own and opened a whole new decade for YG.\r\n\r\nAfter singing \u201cHARU HARU\u201d, \u201cIF YOU\u201d and \u201cBANG BANG BANG\u201d, BIGBANG said, \u201cYG brought BIGBANG together. There are many people here today, and it is because of you we have become who we are today. 10th\u00a0anniversary means a lot to us, and we\u2019re happy to be celebrating this special occasion.

The fact that BLACKPINK is YG\u2019s first group in seven years guaranteed its strong presence and success. But they are doing better and exceeding all expectations.\r\n\r\nBLACKPINK debuted two weeks ago, and they have made remarkable success ever since. They are already setting new records as a girl group that has become no.1 in the shortest amount of time. BLACKPINK debuted by releasing \u201cWHISTLE\u201d and \u201cBOOBAYAH\u201d on August 8. The public responded quickly thanks to their talent and fresh style.\r\n\r\nSince then, BLACKPINK has continued setting new records. \u201cWHISTLE\u201d has been topping the charts for two straight weeks now. Major singers have released new songs, but the song has maintained the no.1 spot and is likely to do so for some time. Although they are only rookies, YANG HYUN SUK and TEDDY have done a good job in prepping them and BLACKPINK is surely on the path to success.\r\n\r\nChart results show the level of popularity among the general public, not just among the fan base. Unlike other new idol groups, BLACKPINK did not appear on TV shows before their debut. So, it is remarkable that so many people know and love their music. Of course, this was in part because BLACKPINK is launched by YG and people are bound to take interest in groups that are launched by such large entertainment companies. But interest would not have transferred to popularity if it wasn\u2019t backed up by good music and fresh style.\r\n\r\nWhat is most surprising is that BLACKPINK became a candidate for no.1 spot of Inkigayo\u2019s chart in just 14 days after debut. It is the shortest time that a girl group became a candidate for the no.1 spot of a national TV music show. This shows the power of BLACKPINK.\r\n\r\nBLACKPINK\u2019s debut stage video surpassed one million views, demonstrating people\u2019s great interest in the group both in and out of the country. Billboards also took interest in the group and said, \u201cBlackpink is only the seventh K-pop act to hit No. 1 on World Digital Songs. The group now joins the company of PSY (who has four No. 1s on the chart), BIGBANG (with three) plus 2NE1, EXO, CL, BTS, plus G-Dragon and Taeyang (all with one). Nevertheless, Blackpink is the fastest act to hit No. 1 on the chart, and only the third to hold the top two positions after PSY and BIGBANG.\u201d\r\n\r\nOf course, BLACKPINK has a long way to go. As they are an YG group, they are expected to aim higher and bigger. They\u2019ve hit a jackpot at the very start of their journey and they are bound to hit some more in the days to come.\r\n\r\n2016. 8. 21.","post_date":"2016-08-30","related_blog":[],"main_image":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/201608211112771500_57b90e988ba55_99_20160821111805.jpg","thumb_2x1":false,"thumb_3x2":false},"833":{"id":833,"post_title":"BLACKPINK Tops All the Charts and Become a Candidate for no.1 of a Music Show Chart","url_friendly_name":"blackpink-tops-all-the-charts-and-become-a-candidate-for-no-1-of-a-music-show-chart","excerpt":"","post_content":"\r\n[\ud150\uc544\uc2dc\uc544=\uc870\ud604\uc8fc \uae30\uc790]\u00a0The nickname \u201cmonster rookie\u201d isn\u2019t enough to describe them.\r\nBLACKPINK swept the no.1 spot of eight music streaming websites, signaling the start of a mega-rookie.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon of August 21, BLACKPINK\u2019s \u201cWHISTLE\u201d took the no.1 spot on the charts of Korea\u2019s eight music streaming websites\u2014Melon, Monkey3, Olleh, Naver Music, Bugs, Mnet, Soribada, and Genie.

While group Sechs Kies is working hard on their upcoming concert, they are going to YG\u2019s recording studio every day. For their first concert in 16 years, Sechs Kies is doing everything from scratch, from the music itself.\r\nSechs Kies goes to YG\u2019s recording studio every day these days. While being busy with preparation for the concert and appearance in TV shows, Sechs Kies has been recording more than 20 songs they will perform in the concert from scratch.\r\nAccording to YG, there were only one or two available accompanying music for Sechs Kies songs as they have not sung for the past 16 years. No one had the accompanying music for Sechs Kies\u2019 songs. Plus, YG does not usually use accompanying music for TV shows in its artists\u2019 concerts, as the company puts great importance on the quality of the sound. Therefore, YG is creating the accompanying music for Sechs Kies\u2019 concert on its own. It shows how big pride YG has in its concerts and how much YG is caring about the quality of its concerts.\r\nYG plays music in multi-tracks from rehearsals and mixes the sound again in compliance with the one-site conditions found in the rehearsals, because echo is generated and sound becomes much different according to the size and circumstances of concert halls. YG\u2019s CEO YANG HYUN SUK puts utmost importance on the quality of sound in concerts, so the first thing he did upon signing the contract with Sechs Kies was to call more than 10 producers and to order them to restore the sound of Sechs Kies\u2019s music that was recorded 16 years ago.\r\nThat is the work to upgrade the sound through mixing by American engineers, while maintaining the originality of Sechs Kies\u2019 music. It is of course hard to rewrite and mix more than 20 songs within a short period of time, but it is even harder for Sechs Kies to record those songs all over again including chorus parts.\r\nAn YG insider said, \u201cIt is only hard at the beginning. Once the recording and mixing is completed, all performances that Sechs Kies will do from now on will be able to boast perfect sound\u201d. As Sechs Kies members are working very hard on the preparation of their concert with YANG HYUN SUK\u2019s full support, many people believe that the concert will be unprecedentedly perfect.\r\nNotably, all the 20,000 tickets for Sechs Kies\u2019 concert have been sold out, proving the team\u2019s still-great presence in the music scene. Such a record also shows how desperately fans have been longing for Sechs Kies\u2019 reunion. Fans are expressing big anticipation for Sechs Kies\u2019 first concert in 16 years.\r\nSechs Kies\u2019 concert \u201c2016 SECHSKIES CONCERT YELLOW NOTE\u201d will be held on September 10 and 11 at Olympic Gymnastics Arena in Seoul.\r\n2016. 8. 26.","post_date":"2016-08-30","related_blog":[],"main_image":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/201608261327778732_57bfc581c732c_99_20160826133604.jpg","thumb_2x1":false,"thumb_3x2":false},"828":{"id":828,"post_title":"BLACKPINK Tops Three Gaon Charts and Writes New History Every Day","url_friendly_name":"blackpink-tops-three-gaon-charts-and-writes-new-history-every-day","excerpt":"","post_content":"\r\n\r\n[OSEN=\ud45c\uc7ac\ubbfc \uae30\uc790]\u00a0BLACKPINK has topped Gaon charts for two consecutive weeks.

The Muhan Company special is a mega special project the goal of which is to make a short movie with the cast of Infinite Challenge. The script of the short movie is written by Kim Eun-hee, the screenwriter of \u201cSignal\u201d. Jang Hang-jun is the director and the cast of Infinite Challenge each have parts.\r\n\r\nOther top actors\/actresses including Lee Jae-hoon, Kim Hae-soo, Jun Kunimura, Kim Hee-won, Jeon Seok-ho, Son Jong-hak, and Jun Mi-sun appear as cameos. BIGBANG\u2019s G-DRAGON also plays a significant role in the short movie.\r\n\r\nIn the making, he looked nervous about acting saying that he agreed to take part only because he liked Infinite Challenge so much. He seemed to be taken aback by the huge scale of the project.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising since it was his first time acting for a legitimate drama. He has had offers to appear in movies and TV dramas but declined them because he couldn\u2019t imagine himself acting seriously. But, now he had no choice but to do his first serious acting for Infinite Challenge, and he seemed to be very nervous about it. Whenever he heard the names of the fellow actors and actresses, he seemed to be embarrassed, and this gave unexpected fun to the viewers.\r\n\r\nInfinite Challenge is very special to G-DRAGON, so much so that he participated in almost all of its special projects. He really likes the show, and the cast of Infinite Challenge really likes him too. But we have never seen him so nervous as this time. Ten years have passed since he debuted, so it is hard to understand why he would ever be nervous in front of a camera. The fact that he is playing an important role and that it is his first time acting for a legitimate movie must have weighed on him.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, G-DRAGON did his utmost and acted for the movie with passion. But, he also had a good laugh when he was around Infinite Challenge members, playing along with their jokes. He was especially kind and considerate to Kwang-hee. When Lee Jae-hoon confessed that he was a big fan of BIGBANG, G-DRAGON gave his number and promised to get him tickets to BIGBANG\u2019s concerts. When Jang Hang-jun asked G-DRAGON if he could take a picture with his wife and daughter, G-DRAGON said yes without any reluctance. We are all looking forward to seeing G-DRAGON in the Muhan Company special, which will be aired next week.\r\n\r\n2016. 8. 28.","post_date":"2016-08-30","related_blog":[],"main_image":"http:\/\/yg.testroo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/201608281044772576_57c2436136363_99_20160828133109.jpg","thumb_2x1":false,"thumb_3x2":false},"818":{"id":818,"post_title":"\u201cAutumn, fantastic GD\u201d\u2026 G-DRAGON presents perfect mood for autumn\u201d","url_friendly_name":"autumn-fantastic-gd-g-dragon-presents-perfect-mood-for-autumn","excerpt":"","post_content":"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Dispatch=\uc774\uc218\uc544\uae30\uc790]\u00a0\u201cBIGBANG\u201ds G-DRAGON proved his fame as a fashionista, boasting unmatched charisma in outfits of a variety of styles.\r\nRecently, G-DRAGON did photo-shooting for the September issue of fashion magazine \u201cElle\u201d.
